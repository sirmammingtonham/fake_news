# New Trick in DNA Editing Could Safely Unlock Thousands of Cures

## A CRISPR startup rewrites tiny mutations instead of cutting and pasting entire genes.

For all its promise to cure disease, the gene-editing tool known as CRISPR still has a lot of unknowns. A big one is its safety: will it edit only the places in the genome it’s supposed to?

Perhaps the most contentious claim about CRISPR, that it could cause hundreds of unintended edits throughout a genome, has [since been retracted](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n6/full/nmeth.4293.html). Even so, scientists still worry it could cause some unwanted DNA insertions or deletions. Other recent research indicates that some versions of CRISPR could make [edited cells more vulnerable to cancer.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0049-z)

Such problems could be avoided with a more precise technique being developed in the labs of David Liu, a professor at Harvard and the Broad Institute. His team’s version of CRISPR involves so-called base editors, which go after much smaller targets — individual letters of DNA.


We all carry about 6 billion DNA bases in our genomes. Each of those bases is a chemical compound that can be abbreviated with one of four letters: A,C, T, or G. And each of those compounds is a member of a “base pair” — an A on one strand of DNA is chemically bound to T on the other side; C pairs with G. Those individual letters are crucial. It turns out that two-thirds of the more than 50,000 human genetic diseases — including sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, and Tay-Sachs disease — are caused by mutations at just one of these points. Where there should be, say, a T bound to an A, a C is bound to a G.

Various versions of CRISPR and other genome-editing technologies could, in theory, fix a lot of those diseases. It’s just that they’d do it by changing more DNA than is necessary. They replace entire genes by making a break in both strands of DNA’s double helix structure. That can create opportunities for certain off-target effects to spring up. In contrast, Liu’s base editing technique zeroes in on just one DNA base at a time. It uses an enzyme that rearranges the chemical makeup of the base so it resembles a compound with a different letter. That tricks cells into fixing the other DNA strand and completing a base pair conversion.
> # “You have to match the right tool for the job.”

In May, Liu launched Beam Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to commercialize base editing for human diseases. One of his co-founders is fellow CRISPR pioneer Feng Zhang, and the team has at least [$87 million in funding](https://beamtx.com/launch-pr/). But they’ve been quiet about which diseases they plan to go after.

I spoke to Liu to try to better understand the state of the technology. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

**Is base editing a competitor to traditional CRISPR?**

I see it a very complementary technology.

**How so?**

The analogy that I frequently use is that CRISPR-Cas9 is like molecular scissors, and base editing is like a pencil. As the analogy implies, for some applications scissors are the best tool for the job, while for other applications a pencil offers real advantages.

**When might base editing be advantageous?**

For a variety of genetic diseases where we know that there is a single point mutation or perhaps a small collection of point mutations, you can make the case that you would rather correct the point mutation than cut the gene and risk creating insertions or deletions that may have unpredictable or unhelpful biological consequences.

The most common consequence of making a double-stranded break in DNA is that the cells’ repair processes can insert or delete random bases at the site of the break. Because base editors don’t make a double-stranded break, they minimize the creation of these insertions.

This doesn’t mean that base editors are better than CRISPR, just like you wouldn’t say a pencil is better than scissors. Really the message is that you have to match the right tool for the job. There are many genetic diseases caused by insertions, deletions, inversions, translocations, or other types of DNA rearrangements for which correction requires breaking the double helix to perform cutting and pasting.

**Just how efficient is base editing now? How often can you make the precise alterations you want?**

We [just published a paper in *Nature Biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4172)* describing base editors with efficiencies sometimes exceeding 50 percent, and with very low levels of undesired editing outcomes. A steady stream of additional improvements to maximize the precision and specificity have already been reported from multiple labs.

**Why did you found Beam Therapeutics now? Why was base editing ready to move out of the lab and be commercialized?**

Because genome-editing therapeutics companies had already been launched and were doing very well and are making tremendous progress in bringing these technologies to patients. That showed there was sufficient interest and that there were resources and need from the patient perspective.

My general philosophy is that we all have an obligation to translate the science we develop for a societal benefit. I never want the end product of our research to be just an article in a journal.

**You co-founded two other startups, Ensemble Therapeutics and Permeon Biologics, based on earlier technologies in your lab. Neither company worked out. What did you learn from those experiences?**

My past experiences [helped] teach me some of the factors that can increase the likelihood that a startup succeeds. Rolling up my sleeves to help with this transition has improved the connection between research projects in our lab and problems that need to be solved, or questions that need to be illuminated.

**We’ve seen a rapid development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the past few years. In China, it’s already being used in clinical trials, and the first trials in the U.S. and Europe could begin soon. How far away is base editing from clinical trials?**

I think it’s too early to speculate.

# Kill Time in Traffic by Diagnosing Cancer

## Kill Time in Traffic by Diagnosing Cancer

### Lou Auguste harnesses robotics and software to amp up remote medicine.

Waiting to hear whether a biopsy turned up cancer is agonizing for anyone. But at least in the U.S., a patient may expect biopsy results [within a week](http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/results_records/get_results). In a poor nation like Haiti, this can take many months, if it happens at all.

There are so few pathologists in Haiti that one hospital until recently [shipped its tests](https://www.pih.org/article/haitis-new-pathology-lab-accelerates-cancer-diagnosis) to doctors in Boston for a 90-day turnaround time. Another, Justinien University Hospital in the city Cap-Haïtien, has given slides directly to patients who travel five hours to Port-au-Prince to get an analysis. Or doctors simply pursue treatment based on their best guess.

Lou Auguste, a New Yorker whose father was born in Haiti, saw the situation at Justinien in 2012 and decided to work on technology that could help. His startup, Alexapath, now wants to create a platform for pathologists anywhere in the world to diagnose patients in Haiti and other countries from their smartphones or desks. His small team is also developing algorithms that he hopes will speed up the work, so one day “human-machine teams” — trained technicians who prepare slides and software that screens them — can further stretch a pathologist’s capacity to assist remote clinics.

For now, [Alexapath](https://beta.alexapath.com/solutions), working from an New York University incubator space, is testing its concept and prototypes more simply. It’s already connected doctors at Justinien with volunteer pathologists in Florida, who have so far diagnosed about 80 cases by looking at slides online, Auguste says.

His next step is to pilot the technology with pathologists in Tanzania and have them review slides in their spare time, perhaps even while sitting in one of the country’s infamous traffic jams. Those doctors, he says, “are like, ‘we’re down to make some more money.’ They charge $15 per diagnosis, so the cost is really low. We’re trying to create a network that is decentralized, so that anyone, anywhere can make a diagnosis.” (Many patients who need help are in Tanzania itself, which only has about 30 pathologists for a population of 55 million and, like Haiti, has regions where no pathologist is available. By comparison, the U.S. has [one pathologist for every 17,000 people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23738764).)
> # Doctors in Tanzania told Auguste “we’re down to make some more money.” They charge $15 per diagnosis.

Tackling global health challenges wasn’t an obvious gig for Auguste. In his previous career as a [film editor and director](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2425799/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr65), he worked on documentaries about graffiti culture, including Banksy’s *Exit Through the Gift Shop*. However, his life changed when he visited Haiti as part of Anderson Cooper’s video crew in the wake of the 2010 earthquake.

“I wanted to help this little kid out who was sitting on this bed and needed to be moved somewhere else, so I picked him up,” he says. “I thought, ‘I like doing this better.’” He stayed in Haiti for a year working with aid organizations.

By the time he returned, he’d decided to do something different with his life. He edged his way into a new career by submitting a design for an app to a charity for the blind. The app made it possible to control TVs with gestures rather than by pressing buttons on a remote control. “I used my powers as a filmmaker and made a film that looked like this mobile app already existed,” he says. The charity awarded him a contract to actually build it.

All the time, he’d been returning to Haiti periodically, and found his way to Justinien because his father, a surgeon in the U.S., knew doctors there. Auguste began thinking about how to help the hospital get cancer diagnoses faster. That led him to team up with two friends with engineering backgrounds and launch Alexapath. Why the name? Take Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone and progenitor of descendant terms like “telemedicine,” and add “pathology.”

Alexapath’s goal may not sound particularly novel. Telepathology has been practiced for decades. In 2001, Swiss researchers launched iPath, [an early online platform](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21284440) where pathologists could seek second opinions. And eventually human pathologists might not be needed to review many biopsy slides at all. Google announced this year that it had trained software to be at least as accurate as doctors in assessing 130 breast cancer samples — and the human doctors needed 30 hours to do the work. Several other companies, including IBM and Philips, are also developing artificial-intelligence systems for radiology, pathology, and other diagnostic fields.

Even so, there are still few low-cost and flexible options that can scale widely in the developing world. Many rural clinics can’t afford the expensive specialized microscope systems used to create high-quality digital images and run into problems uploading large image files at slow Internet speeds, according to Mwombeki Fabian, a Tanzanian digital health entrepreneur and clinician who is opening a modern diagnostic lab in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and is working with Auguste.
> # “They should be helping figure out how to cure diseases, instead of looking at pap smears all day long.”

Alexapath’s technology is meant to work more affordably with standard microscopes, the kind that even strapped hospitals in Haiti would have. Iterating with his two co-founders over nearly four years, Auguste has developed a camera and a robotic slide holder that fits on the microscope, so that it can be remotely controlled by a pathologist elsewhere. A doctor in, for example, Tanzania, views the patient’s slide, and uses Alexapath’s software to offer a remote diagnosis. Because the doctor is examining smaller portions of tissue at a time, it gets around some of the challenges of slower Internet speeds, Auguste says.

So far, Alexapath’s roughly $500,000 budget has come from grants and personal investments, but Auguste says the next step is to involve institutional investors. When I met him this summer Auguste was preparing to go to India and make a pitch to Qualcomm about algorithms Alexapath has developed to screen pap smear slides. The company’s working with three regional hospitals in India to launch field trials, in support of the Indian government’s goal of implementing cervical cancer screenings everywhere. The AI-based “diagnostic support” software that Alexapath is developing, Auguste says, could flag slides that need a closer look from a doctor, screening out the obvious negatives.

Auguste envisions AI and remote diagnostic technologies eventually combining to help stretch the limited time that pathologists have. “They should be helping figure out how to cure diseases,” he says, “instead of looking at pap smears all day long.”

# The Language of DNA Should Rewrite English, Too

## Jargon from the pre-genomics era blinds us to new possibilities.

![**“Birth defect” written in a typeface created out of chromosomes by Studio Lennarts & de Bruijn for NEO.LIFE.**](1*5YrfeFQ3Rhn9UKGSxsaL6w.jpeg)***“Birth defect” written in a typeface created out of chromosomes by Studio Lennarts & de Bruijn for NEO.LIFE.***

Translation is the process of converting one language to another. In biomedicine, it means something less literal: it’s when scientific advances — new diagnostics, therapies, methods — translate into clinically meaningful tools that improve human health.

But words and metaphors matter in medicine, and during a period of rapid change, the evolution of a lexicon can be as important as the underlying science. We’re in such a time now. The genomics era is upon us, which makes pre-genomic jargon increasingly unhelpful. We use old vocabulary out of habit even as the letters of our DNA illuminate new ways forward.

Take, for example, the term *birth defect*, which is the subject of [*Imperfect Pregnancies](https://www.amazon.com/Imperfect-Pregnancies-History-Prenatal-Diagnosis/dp/1421423634?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=neodotlife-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=026ee997db6b9c6030953a94732a9b58&camp=1789&creative=9325)*, a 2017 book by Ilana Löwy, a French health researcher. A 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report defined birth defects as including “congenital malformations, congenital deformations and chromosomal abnormalities,” and it attributed 20 percent of infant mortality to such birth defects. The CDC’s definition captures conditions ranging from small head size (also known as microcephaly, a major fear during the Zika epidemic), to a hole in a heart wall (made infamous by Jimmy Kimmel’s son, Billy), to Down syndrome (caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21). These are all things detected in a newborn or during a pregnancy, through methods such as ultrasound imaging or blood tests for chromosomal abnormalities.

Importantly, the sorts of conditions in the CDC’s definition of birth defects do *not* include a slew of severe genetic diseases that affect tens of thousands of babies and children each year. One such disease is Tay-Sachs, a horrible condition that destroys nerve cells, killing most affected children before they would have entered elementary school. And yet, a baby born with Tay-Sachs appears physically normal for months or years; his chromosomes, too, appear normal. This is because Tay-Sachs is a monogenic disease, arising out of a single gene mutation, best diagnosed using next-generation sequencing technology. It does not come up in ultrasound or chromosomal analysis.
> # It would be folly to ignore the ways that genomic medicine can free babies of predictable, devastating genetic diseases.

But while the CDC doesn’t describe Tay-Sachs as a birth defect, it’s the kind of thing cutting-edge commercial genetic testing companies have in mind when they use *birth defects* in their marketing materials. These companies are specifically talking about deadly monogenic diseases like Tay-Sachs.

How to make sense of these different uses of a common term? Should genetic testing companies use a different word for deterministic monogenic defects than the one for anatomical defects with uncertain prognoses?

These sorts of questions are not mere semantics, because the way that we name different conditions affects standards of medical care, as well as our perception of the conditions themselves. That is, *birth defect* carries conscious and unconscious associations that could hamper the adoption of new tools designed to detect, treat, and most importantly prevent genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs. Unlike microcephaly and other defects that are not detectable until a pregnancy is well underway, a monogenic disease is often predictable with genetic screening of the parents, rendering it preventable through one of several options.

One such option is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which screens embryos created through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and implants only those without the disease-causing mutation. IVF-plus-PGD saves thousands of lives, and could save many thousands more; but it is expensive. More clearly describing Tay-Sachs as a preventable disease rather than as a defect will shape physicians’ thinking about recommending procedures like IVF-plus-PGD and influence how insurance companies pay for them.

![**“Public health,” by Studio Lennarts & de Bruijn.**](1*7uJ2OmfGxl_WjKCB0DKVEA.jpeg)***“Public health,” by Studio Lennarts & de Bruijn.***

If overuse of the term *birth defect* might be slowing down genomic applications, then our definition of *public health* is also due for a rethink. Löwy distinguishes between “public-health-oriented” and “autonomy-oriented” forms of prenatal testing. Screening for HIV or hepatitis is in the first category, screening for a genetic abnormality is in the second. Her historical review is intriguing, but this distinction reflects a pre-genomic worldview, and today we are due for a change in the way we speak about public health. Genomics represents the shared inheritance of a family and of a community, and so genomic health ought to become public health.

Expanding the definition of public health to include monogenic diseases would be meaningful because of the ways that public-health challenges galvanize innovation and collaboration across the private, public, and philanthropic sectors. While public and private capital has poured into research on the genetics of cancer — long touted as a public health priority — the pace of innovation for programs tied to rare disease genetics has been slower. Monogenic diseases aren’t so rare when pooled together, but compared to cancer or HIV, the emotional and economic burdens of monogenic diseases still feel more like isolated concerns for an unlucky family than shared costs for a community.

*Imperfect Pregnancies* straddles a tectonic shift in the field of family medicine. As it tracks the study of birth defects and pregnancy screening over the course of the 20th century in Europe and the U.S., the book helps us recognize the paths that led to our current assumptions. From here on out, though, more precise language can alter the paths forward. It may be a fool’s errand to pursue a perfect pregnancy as measured by ultrasound and chromosomal analysis, but it would be folly to ignore the ways that genomic medicine can free babies of predictable, devastating genetic diseases. We shouldn’t let promising innovations become lost in translation.

# The Real Way Science Empowers Us

## Seeing the universe as it is gives us strength rooted in humility.

![Illustration by Azamat Akhmadbaev](1*i4lAbeOmjyGnZcdP-zN0Ww.jpeg)*Illustration by Azamat Akhmadbaev*

Science has made us the masters of the universe we’ve always dreamed ourselves to be. We hold all of human knowledge in our pockets, billions of times the catalog of the Library of Alexandria. We fly around the world in mere hours and are annoyed by the lack of legroom. We have invested objects with intelligence. We rewrite the code hidden in our very cells. We visited the moon, and then stopped going because we got bored. Our conversations, music, and culture have forever broken the constraints of physical proximity. We have subdued famine, plague, and pestilence, and while we have not yet conquered death, we have dramatically extended life.

And yet, even as science has apotheosized us, it has revealed our fundamental insignificance.

We are not made in the image of an all-seeing god. We are as much a part of nature as amoebas and made of the same stuff. Turtles have been around more than a hundred times longer than uppity *Homo sapiens*. Our sacred texts do not describe natural laws. They are, at best, popular science fiction. Our intuitions are wrong. The Earth is round, time is mere illusion, and we are but one of myriad results of millions of years of evolution. We are not the center of the universe. We live on a tiny rock orbiting a random sun in a backwater solar system in a nondescript galaxy in one expanding universe among many. That same scale is mirrored in the complexity of the subatomic world. For countless generations we believed we were special, but science has shown us that we are only as special as everything else.

Is this a paradox? Maybe not. Maybe science’s greatest gift is how it forces us to confront generations of hubris. Maybe we can learn to use our shiny new tools with a humility rooted in awe at the vast universe we are lucky enough to inhabit. Maybe stripping away the delusion of power is the most empowering thing of all.

# This Artist Saw the Neobiological Future Before Any of Us

## This Artist Saw the Neobiological Future Before Any of Us

### Lynn Hershman Leeson has spent 40 years grappling with cyborgs, genetically modified organisms, and AI.

Around the time Lynn Hershman Leeson was making her film [*Tecknolust](https://www.fandor.com/films/teknolust)*, the rough draft of the Human Genome project was being finished, the first human embryo was cloned, and the TOR browser was being finalized. That helps explain why ideas about biological destiny and anonymity ran through the movie, which starred Tilda Swinton in multiple roles, including a scientist named Rosetta Stone and three Self-Replicating Automatons that require a constant supply of the Y chromosome (found in semen) in order to live.

For decades, Hershman Leeson has explored the relationships between human identity, science, and surveillance through a feminist lens. In the 1970s she created an alter ego named Roberta Breitmore; in the 1990s she extended that identity into a doll called CybeRoberta, whose camera eyes were a reminder that humans are tethered to and watched by the machines they build.

![**CybeRoberta (1996)** **is a replica of Roberta Breitmore, a fictional persona that Hershman Leeson created and inhabited from 1973 to 1978.

This was recently on display in a solo exhibition of Hershman Leeson’s work, titled *Civic Radar*, at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The first piece that visitors saw as they entered the main gallery was one of Hershman Leeson’s recent works, “The Infinity Engine.” In part of the work, projections on the walls and mirrors give the illusion of walking down the hallways of a hospital or laboratory; the mirrors slightly distort your reflection, making you a bit elongated. They suggest two worlds, one made rigid by the scientific method and the other full of malleable organisms that technologies can manipulate.

Turning a sharp corner, the viewer was confronted with Hershman Leeson’s reinterpreted Michelangelo’s *The Creation of Adam*. Instead of Adam and God extending fingertips, two latex-gloved hands and the tips of syringes touch, implying the calculation and design of creation today. To further that point, Leeson’s exhibit included creations from scientists around the world, such as [Anthony Atala](https://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_printing_a_human_kidney) of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, who has researched 3-D-printed organs.

Hershman Leeson’s consultations with scientists led to a part of the “Infinity Engine” that included a seemingly endless array of photos of genetic experiments and advanced technologies. It showed hybrid species and unconventional techniques that could be crucial for human survival—possibilities that are both utopian and dystopian.

So where does she go from here? Deeply inward, apparently. Hershman Leeson says she is working on storing a movie in—and somehow projecting it from—DNA.

# Why We Loved “Orphan Black”

## Why We Loved “Orphan Black”

### A thriller about cloning, gene editing, and bioengineering is the perfect show for our times.

You don’t usually see TV shows mention the supposed “fountain of youth” gene *LIN28A,* show [nanopore sequencing](https://medium.com/neodotlife/nanopore-6443c81d76d3), or use cloning as the backbone of the plot. That’s what makes *Orphan Black* so great.

The cult Canadian TV show just ended its five-year run, all the better for [binge-watching it now](http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/orphan-black). It had a relatively small viewership, but anyone who followed the series saw science fiction that was deeply grounded in science nonfiction. Its characters raised questions about the ethics of biotechnology that we already face or [will face in the near future](https://medium.com/neodotlife/doudna-book-cbf1820c88a9).

Science historian Cosima Herter helped create the show and is the namesake of one character, a scientist clone who’s investigating her own biology. Clone Cosima and the rest of the genetically identical characters (incredibly, all played by one actress, Tatiana Maslany) gradually uncover the ways other scientists at evil corporations have been exploiting them for shadowy experiments and personal gain. Those bad-guy scientists call themselves Neolutionists (no relation to NEO.LIFE!), and they describe their goal as “self-directed evolution.”

![](1*hT4Oxz5qmyG91EMy0j_Mew.png)

### Flawed clones

One of the Neolutionists’ main methods is cloning. Though the show is set in the present, scientifically *Orphan Black *takes place in “a bit of an alternate timeline,” says Nina Nesseth. She and Casey Griffin, a developmental biology graduate student at the University of Southern California, wrote the new [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32073086-the-science-of-orphan-black) *The Science of Orphan Black: The Official Companion.*

In the show’s universe, scientists successfully (and secretly) created human clones in the 1980s. But in the real world, the famous cloned sheep named Dolly wasn’t born until 1996. Since then, researchers have successfully cloned human embryos, but haven’t let them develop further. Human reproductive cloning is banned in more than 40 countries. It’s not a federal crime in the United States, but it’s banned in some states.

Cloning humans and other primates is technically difficult. One of the main things that goes wrong is that the cloning process messes with “spindle proteins” that help cells divide. *Orphan Black* was smart enough to take this subject on. In the second season, one of the cloning masterminds says his wife “solved the spindle protein problem.”

Even if scientists surmount such difficulties in the real world, a [2017 Gallup poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/6028/cloning.aspx) found that 83 percent of U.S. adults think it would be morally wrong to clone a human. And the clones on *Orphan Black* are indeed unhappy to learn that they’re part of an experiment they didn’t consent to. The show, Nesseth says, forces us to ask: Could a clone’s creator claim ownership of that person? Could a clone, or a clone’s DNA, be patented? What unexpected problems might arise in a clone? In the show, nearly all of them are dying of a mysterious genetic disease.

“I think the show highlights basically all of the main reasons why it would just not be good” to clone humans, Griffin adds.

### “This stuff is cool”

The illness slowly killing off the *Orphan Black *clones is an accidental side effect of the genome tweaks that the Neolutionists engineered to make the clones sterile. By the show’s present day, these scientists have moved on from cloning and are using other types of gene editing to change people’s evolutionary fates. In a sinister assisted-reproduction facility, they engineer ideal babies (or deformed ones). Another technology delivers gene therapy to adults via not-so-realistic cyborg maggots. (*Orphan Black* didn’t invent that plot device. The cyborg bug meme crops up a lot, from TV’s *Black Mirror *to *Star Wars: Episode II—Attack of the Clones*.)

Spoiler alert: one Neolutionist is fiddling with a particular gene to try to live longer. It’s *LIN28A*, which in reality has some [fountain-of-youth properties](http://www.nature.com/news/fountain-of-youth-gene-unleashes-healing-power-1.14128). It’s normally active only in embryos; the protein it makes the body produce appears to work wonders for tissue repair. But as Griffin points out, engineering this gene to be active in an adult would be unlikely to make the Neolutionists live longer. Longevity is “not as simple as one gene,” she says.

And no matter how much future parents manipulate their children’s genomes, they won’t be able to control who those children mate with. The progeny of people with edited genomes will probably regress to the mean and not start a race of superhumans, says University of Alabama at Birmingham bioethicist Gregory Pence, who also wrote a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25942860-what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-clone-club) about *Orphan Black, *called *What We Talk About When We Talk About Clone Club. *That means the Neolutionists on *Orphan Black* probably wouldn’t succeed in their goal of trying to control human evolution.

They also aren’t very good scientists, say Nesseth and Griffin. A better model is Cosima, the scientist clone. Her curiosity drives her to pursue the same questions as the Neolutionists, but “with the goal of helping people, and giving people options,” Griffin says. “Cosima just thinks this stuff is cool.”

# When Computers Read Your Mind, You’ll Need a Great Passthought

## Berkeley researchers may have the perfect authentication device — assuming you’re okay with a computer analyzing your thoughts.

![Illustration by Igor Bastidas](1*YqY_I0alS9r_Jj5RsKilyg.gif)*Illustration by Igor Bastidas*

The safest way for UC Berkeley professor John Chuang to log on to his computer is to put on a headset that reads his EEG signals and then silently think of the soaring strains of the *Star Wars* theme.

Imagining the song activates the temporal lobe of his brain in a certain pattern, which can be detected by a consumer-grade EEG headset that wirelessly connects to a computer. Chuang, an electrical engineer, has developed an algorithm that recognizes that pattern and unlocks his computer. That makes the *Star Wars* tune Chuang’s “passthought” — kind of like a password in that it’s secret knowledge that’s easy for him to remember. But it’s much stronger than a password, because each brain shows up on an EEG with a telltale electrical signature that’s most likely unique. So Chuang doesn’t mind that you know his passthought. It’s even published on a UC Berkeley Web page. Because if you sat at his computer and thought of the same song, you still couldn’t log in.

This is not just a proof of concept. “I firmly believe that passwords will inevitably become obsolete in a post-screen, post-keyboard world,” Chuang says. “And passthoughts will quickly gain traction once we become accustomed to wearing computers on our heads or faces. This is actually not as far down the road as we may think.”

As they test the passthought on themselves and research subjects, Chuang and his students in the UC Berkeley BioSENSE Lab are not just trying to perfect a better method of authentication. They’re also racing to address tricky questions that will be posed by computers that can get inside our heads, thanks to improvements in EEG devices like the kinds used by neurogamers and to [brain-machine interfaces yet to come](https://medium.com/neodotlife/brain-machine-abc53a3b27ca). Is a passthought a privacy nightmare, or is it a privacy enhancement if it makes your computer much harder to hack? If a passthought or some other brain-scanning technology doesn’t work when you’re drunk, over-caffeinated, or under mental duress, are you ready for machines to decide when you are in your right mind?

The passthought works because, Chuang says, “brainwave signals are like our fingerprints, they are biometric. The argument is that even identical twins will produce different EEG signals, because of the way their cerebral cortex — the outer layer of our brain — is folded. That modulates the EEG signals.” Sarah Laszlo, a psychologist at Binghamton University, was one of two lead authors on a [2016 study](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-04/bu-rci041816.php) that achieved 100 percent accuracy in using EEG scans as an identifier. Though it would take a scan of every person in the world to definitively prove the uniqueness of each brain, Laszlo says Chuang is making a “reasonable assumption” by using the EEG as a biometric.

Chuang’s software merely matches the telltale frequencies of any particular person’s passthought to data in a database. “It has no semantic knowledge of what you’re thinking,” says Noura Howell, a Ph.D. student in the BioSENSE Lab. But to the user, it might feel like a machine has intruded on the inmost sanctum of the brain and is recognizing secret thoughts. “People get creeped out when we put the thing on their head,” Nick Merrill, another Ph.D. student in the BioSENSE Lab, acknowledges.

The BioSENSE researchers have tried passthoughts with roughly 100 people in the lab, but now they’re fanning out to test the technology with headsets and ear-mounted EEG units out and about in the world. One big question will be how long a passthought remains viable before the brain changes too much.

Chuang says it will be up to someone else to commercialize passthoughts. When you’re a researcher, any malfunction or shortcoming of passthoughts is an opportunity to write a kick-ass paper — not a near-death experience for your business. “If we discover downsides, vulnerabilities, privacy and security implications, we want to be the first to point them out,” Chuang says. “If I have some venture capitalist behind me, I may be tempted to withhold.”

# The Shocking Thing About the Brain

## The Shocking Thing About the Brain

### **An electrical-stimulation technology with promising new uses comes from a dark age that still has a lot to teach us.**

History does not look kindly on biological psychiatry. Beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, electroshock therapy, the lobotomy, and related psychosurgeries were administered widely and liberally, until chlorpromazine, the first antipsychotic medication, was introduced in the 1950s.

We now think of this as a dark age in psychiatry, during which barbaric treatments were meted out on hundreds of thousands of patients around the world, often to devastating effect, and without consent. Most practitioners believed they were helping their patients, but the methods they employed were very crude, and they had few checks and balances, so it may be better to think of them as being misguided, rather than malicious.


What, then, should we make of deep brain stimulation, a technology that has roots in that same era?

DBS, as it’s known, is a highly invasive procedure in which ultra-thin wire electrodes are implanted, via small holes drilled through the skull, into a specified brain region. The device, sometimes referred to as a “brain pacemaker,” is powered by a small battery implanted under the skin of the chest, and emits electrical pulses that modulate brain activity in the targeted area, in ways that are still not fully understood.

Since it gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002, it has been used to treat an estimated 100,000 people with Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders. It’s been rightly hailed as revolutionary in its ability to alleviate tremors and other Parkinson’s symptoms, and these successes have led researchers to investigate the possibility of using DBS to treat other conditions — including psychiatric disorders.

DBS is widely believed to have been developed by researchers in France in the late 1980s. But as investigative journalist Lone Frank reveals in [*The Pleasure Shock: The Rise of Deep Brain Stimulation and Its Forgotten Inventor](https://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Shock-Stimulation-Forgotten-Inventor/dp/1101986530?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=neodotlife-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f9713c6d5805c6dad9d1e3967a6a1711&camp=1789&creative=9325)*, it was actually developed three decades earlier by [Robert G. Heath](http://thejns.org/doi/full/10.3171/2017.6.FOCUS17252) at Tulane University.

![](1*VjI4eoxNfTrj3AWUJTz8Tg.png)

Heath is a hugely divisive figure. On the one hand, he was a pioneering neuropsychiatrist who recognized the intimate links between mental functions and the body long before the concept of embodied cognition became trendy, and he saw brain dysfunction as the root cause of mental illness. On the other hand, he pushed the boundaries of science and ethics and often crossed those lines altogether.

*The Pleasure Shock* begins with an experiment in which Heath explored “the possibility of altering” the sexual orientation of a 24-year-old homosexual man “through electrical stimulation of pleasure sites of the brain,” while the participant [watched pornography and spent time with a prostitute](http://www.violence.de/heath/jnmd/1972paper.pdf). Heath also tested the effects of LSD and the brainwashing drug bulbocapnine on unwitting African-American prisoners at Louisiana State Penitentiary, allegedly as part of the CIA’s MK-Ultra “mind-control” program that ran from the 1950s into the ’70s.

![](1*gGPcWNrrjVR3883KODB4Iw.jpeg)

On the face of it, Heath’s story appears to parallel the life and work of the notorious Walter Freeman, who lobotomised more than 4,500 people in North America during the 1940s and early ’50s, as described by Jack El-Hai in his 2005 book, *The Lobotomist*. Freeman, like Heath, was highly driven, and was overzealous, or perhaps unscrupulous, in pursuing what he believed were significant breakthroughs in the treatment of mental illness. Perhaps because of the highly controversial nature of Heath’s work, his contributions and legacy were eventually all but forgotten, and Frank describes the great lengths she had to go to track down documents about Heath’s work, as well as his surviving patients and colleagues.

This brings us back to today.

The successes of using DBS to treat Parkinson’s have not been mirrored in psychiatric patients so far. That’s partly because psychiatric disorders are far more complex, presenting a constellation of symptoms rather than a well-characterized pathology. The use of DBS in psychiatry therefore remains highly experimental.

However, we are about to see the emergence of what could be called precision psychosurgery, in which DBS and various other neuromodulatory approaches will be available to treat anything from anxiety to obesity. In 2008, the FDA approved the use of DBS for treatment of [obsessive-compulsive disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5735431/), under the [Humanitarian Device Exemption](https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/howtomarketyourdevice/premarketsubmissions/humanitariandeviceexemption/default.htm). And it could yet prove to be a life-saving approach for patients with treatment-resistant depression, even though [a flagship trial was abruptly halted](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/zapping-peoples-brains-didnt-cure-their-depression-until-it-did/558032/) last year.

Although future generations will undoubtedly look back at today’s technologies and therapies as crude, advances in our understanding of how the brain works, coupled with continuing technological advances, will surely make these interventions increasingly precise and effective in years to come.

![](1*R9F9a_jei16dKmvxHkfofA.png)

That’s why the work of Heath, Freeman, and others like them is worth understanding. It’s not merely so we can denounce those scientists as evil. We should draw on their stories to think about how to use new techniques wisely — to stick to [evidence-based theories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26909704) of disease and test potential new therapies rigorously while preventing the exploitation of vulnerable patients and recognizing their autonomy.

Beyond this, DBS raises other thorny questions.

When Heath fitted his homosexual patient with a device he could use to stimulate the septal region of his brain on his own, the man had “feelings of pleasure, alertness, and warmth (goodwill); he had feelings of sexual arousal and a compulsion to masturbate.” The man stimulated his own brain up to 500 times per hour, and “protested each time the unit was taken away from him, pleading to self-stimulate just a few more times,” a phenomenon also observed more recently in patients treated with DBS for both depression and OCD. And there are growing numbers of reports that DBS and other forms of brain stimulation can [improve memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447081/) and even [influence moral behavior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319982/), though not always for the better.

With the implantation surgery alone costing up to $50,000, use of DBS will not quickly become widespread. Eventually, though, the procedure and instruments it requires will be accessible to greater numbers of people — not just to treat disease but, possibly, also as a form of enhancement.

Could there be some risk of creating a population of “pleasure addicts” who want nothing more than to self-administer electrical pulses to the brain? And if we can use brain stimulation to manipulate morality, do we have a moral obligation to treat “bad” people? Such questions help us to delineate the ethical minefield that Heath faced, one that we still will have to navigate.

# Are You a Wizard or a Prophet?

## Are You a Wizard or a Prophet?

### A new book argues that technology and environmentalism clash. But that’s not a useful way to think about the future.

The term “GMO” can be a Rorschach test. It makes some people see potential for plants that can grow in any ecosystem, resist drought and disease, and yield massive amounts of food and prosperity for all. *Human innovation,* this camp says, *can get us out of any jam.*

But many environmentalists see a racket that will give mega-corporations control over the world’s food supply and encourage thoughtless consumption. *We are part of the Earth’s global ecosystem, *the second group contends,* we can’t “bio-hack” our way out of every problem.*

In his latest book,* [The Wizard and the Prophet: Two Remarkable Scientists and Their Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow’s World](https://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Prophet-Remarkable-Scientists-Tomorrows/dp/0307961699?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=neodotlife-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=35d370c49862b9a00c52227f9a471d2a&camp=1789&creative=9325)*, journalist Charles C. Mann traces current incarnations of these world views to two 20th-century figures — agronomist Norman Borlaug and ecologist/activist William Vogt. Both men were unlikely scientists, and both have left their fingerprints all over environmental thought.

![](1*xPQss4p_2FbzA4XpV1dk0A.png)

Vogt — the temperamental “prophet” — was the author of the incendiary best-seller *Road to Survival*, first published in 1948. He converted to “apocalyptic environmentalism” while working a data collection job for an international company that sold guano — bird poop — as fertilizer. After spending countless hours in a sweltering shack documenting the lives of guano birds, Vogt became convinced that all species, humans included, are subject to the same ecological limits. His writings popularized the idea of the “environment” as a single planet-spanning whole.

Meanwhile, Borlaug — the “wizard” — was busy breeding extra-bountiful wheat strains that were drought-proof, fungus-proof, and wind-proof and could grow in developing countries such as Mexico, India, and Pakistan. His work prevented the starvation of millions and garnered him a Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. As a leader of the original “Green Revolution,” Borlaug hoped to use science and technology to bring prosperity for all.

*The Wizard and the Prophet* juxtaposes the lives and ideas of these two men and weaves in stories featuring many of their contemporaries. Though much of the book focuses on the scientists’ successes and origin stories, Mann does touch on uglier aspects of their legacies: millions of forced sterilizations carried out in the name of “population control,” and widespread land grabs that left millions homeless after higher crop yields made formerly unprofitable land worth stealing. Neither man intended these outcomes, though Vogt did argue that having fewer people would be more sustainable.

Mann plays the role of impartial but helpful guide, punctuating the history with anecdotes featuring his neighbor, the eminent (and somewhat eccentric) biologist Lynn Margulis, who died in 2011. The book also includes an elementally themed interlude on how later “wizards” and “prophets” have addressed four of humanity’s biggest problems — food (earth), freshwater supply (water), energy (fire), and climate change (air). The result is an informative tapestry of conservation biology past and present.

*The Wizard and the Prophet* positions the “reduce, reuse, recycle, or die!” and “innovate and thrive!” mindsets as two ends of a spectrum. “Prophets” value community, conservation, and connection to the local land. “Wizards” typically innovate in service of a global marketplace. Mann argues that few people are deeply committed to both.

It’s hard to say which mindset is more characteristic of the current zeitgeist. But, Mann tells us, the people of his daughter’s generation (Gen Z and Millennials) will have to choose a path.

The question Mann poses — “wizard or prophet?” — reminds me of a scene from the Beatles’ movie* A Hard Day’s Night, *where an interviewer asks Ringo, “Are you a mod or a rocker?” (“Mods” and “rockers” were two camps in mid-’60s British counterculture. Mods favored bright colors, futuristic fashions, and boundary-pushing music. Rockers, in contrast, were all about motorcycles, leather, and throwbacks to rebels of the 1950s.)

Ringo replies, “I dunno. I guess I’m a mocker.”

And that’s more or less how I feel about the “wizard or prophet” question. (I guess I’m a prizard? Or a wophet?) Mann himself admits that he alternates between the two viewpoints on an almost daily basis. And I am not convinced that the two strategies are diametrically opposed. Wizards’ technical and infrastructural innovations often encourage rapid consumption, but they can also make it easier for prophets to live within “natural” ecological limits. And, in turn, prophets’ work on understanding local communities and ecosystem dynamics are necessary for maximizing the benefits of wizards’ breakthroughs.

The wizard/prophet dynamic is useful for classifying historical figures and understanding the motives of conservationists and ecosystem engineers, but I’m not sure how well it holds as a description of the choices ahead. Instead, the next generation may have to reconcile the two paths.

# The Deepest Free Diver of Them All

## The Deepest Free Diver of Them All

### Facing troubling news in his DNA, William Trubridge displays a competitive advantage not found in his genome: equanimity. Final chapter in a three-part series.

*Read the first two parts of this series [here](https://medium.com/neodotlife/decodingtrubridge1-8a853432fc75) and [here](https://medium.com/neodotlife/decodingtrubridge2-262a456b891e).*

Competitive free diving — in which athletes descend to crushing depths on a single breath and frequently lose consciousness on the way back up — hardly seems like a pastime for late middle age, like tennis. It has been described as “the world’s second-most dangerous activity, after jumping off skyscrapers with parachutes.”

Yet older athletes have accomplished some of its signal achievements. In the 1970s, the French diver Jacques Mayol, whose life inspired the cult classic film *The Big Blue*, set a world record, reaching a depth of 330 feet in a “no limits” dive, in which athletes are permitted to use weighted sleds to hasten their descent. He was 49 years old at the time. In the 1980s, he bested this feat by descending to 344 feet — at the age of 56. More recently, the legendary Russian diver Natalia Molchanova broke a world record at the age of 53.

This may be, in part, because free diving depends so heavily on mental fortitude. The best divers can clear their minds of tension, distraction, and even conscious thought as they descend. William Trubridge, a New Zealander who has broken 18 world records, has adopted a series of mantras when underwater, including “shut down, shut down …” and “now is all, now is all…” Older divers are more mature, he says, “more mentally equipped to deal with stress and performance anxiety.” Individuals’ metabolisms may also slow with age, making it easier to conserve oxygen.

Trubridge, who is 36, plans to dive for the rest of his life, at least as an amateur. But the question of how long he’ll persist as an elite competitive athlete recently surfaced when he decided to have his genome sequenced. In January, he learned that he carries a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease known as APOE e4. Because Alzheimer’s progression is correlated with higher concentrations of iron in the brain, the scientists at Veritas Genetics who provided his results advised that over time he ought to slash his iron intake.

![**Trubridge swims along a guide line on a free dive.** (Still from a video by Jason Tongen)](1*zQVrAnf6zMGzyVvZ_KbP-g.png)***Trubridge swims along a guide line on a free dive.** (Still from a video by Jason Tongen)*

This advice seems to collide, however, with Trubridge’s long-term athletic prospects. To excel at the highest levels, he must maximize his blood’s oxygen-carrying capacity, in part by supplementing aggressively with iron — divers call it iron loading. In other words, to maintain his preeminence, he is dosing his blood and brain with the one nutrient most likely to cause him long-term, cognitive harm. (“It’s pretty clear what the actions are to take,” says Preston Estep III, the chief science officer of Veritas who presented Trubridge with his results.)

Yet Trubridge has responded to the news with remarkable serenity, displaying the very trait that has made him so successful as a diver: his skill at absorbing conflict and tension and dissolving them away. The first time he took an iron supplement after receiving his genomic results, “it took on an extra significance for sure, but it didn’t make me hesitate or sway my habits,” he says. “It’s not something that hit me hard or freaked me out at all.”
> # Scientists are only beginning to explore the complex underpinnings of resilience.

The chances that Trubridge will develop Alzheimer’s disease in the next 10 years are low, according to the scientists at Veritas. And so, he reasons, if he ends his competitive career in his 40s — and no longer supplements with iron — he can mitigate his risk to a reasonable degree. “In terms of competing and pushing myself so aggressively, I think that’s untenable past some point in my 40s,” he says. (Whether that represents a bit of rationalization — combined with mental fortitude — is hard to say.)

Trubridge’s genomic report did not include any analysis of his psychological traits, such as his variant (or variants) of a gene called COMT, which appears to help determine whether someone has “warrior” or “worrier” tendencies. So the compelling question of why he and other elite free divers can rid themselves of tension so successfully remains unanswered. Natalia Molchanova often spoke about a Russian technique known as attention deconcentration. “You focus on the edges, not the center of things, as if you were looking at a screen,” [she told a *New Yorker* reporter](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/24/the-deepest-dive). “Basically, all the time I am diving, I have an empty consciousness. I have a kind of melody going through my mind that keeps me going, but otherwise I am completely not in my mind.”

Trubridge, too, has spoken about the melody of church bells, which he sometimes sings to himself very slowly. He does this so that his “heart and everything falls into the very slow rhythm and everything slows down,” pushing away the negative thoughts, like “’you’re gonna die down here.’” (Molchanova did die, in 2015, while free diving off the coast of Spain.)

Kerry Hollowell, a free diver and the medical officer of the diving organization AIDA, speculates that free divers have an unusual ability to “let go completely, trusting in their bodies and letting go of their minds, surrendering to the water.” Free divers’ training puts an enormous emphasis on meditation and breathing techniques. For some, these practices may strengthen a predisposition toward resilience, mental discipline, and calm. At the same time, these breathing techniques might also teach people who are prone to anxiety not to panic, says Hollowell, who is an emergency room physician. Diving has helped her not to “freak out when someone is dying in front of me.”


In recent years, scientists have begun to explore the complex underpinnings of resilience. These include the genetic, molecular, neural, and hormonal mechanisms that seem to go hand in hand with the ability to manage stress without succumbing to psychiatric illness. A growing consensus suggests that “resilience in humans represents an active, adaptive process, and not simply the absence of pathological responses that occur in susceptible individuals,” according to Eric Nestler, director of the Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai in New York.

The ethos of freediving would seem to support these findings. As would Trubridge’s response to his APOE e4 results, which seem to have dissipated in his mind like a stream of bubbles. Indeed, whatever the conflict that others might perceive between Trubridge’s genes and his ambitions, his own takeaway has been that “there wasn’t any major windfall or anything I had to wrap my head around so it was quite an easy thing.” Which is to say, Trubridge’s head game seems as freakish as his ability to collapse his lungs beneath his rib cage.

Diving is “like stepping into the realm of death,” he says. And the lesson it teaches — which he applies to life, as well — is that the diver must dissociate from the future, even when that feels like a “counter-instinctive thing to do.”

# Angela Belcher Commands a Virus to Hunt a Deadly Cancer

## An engineer lights up tiny tumors that doctors can’t see.

![Illustration by Agata Nowicka](1*sfhkN2soPbjbPFUty2zeAA.jpeg)*Illustration by Agata Nowicka*

MIT professor Angela Belcher earned a MacArthur genius grant by engineering a harmless virus to [form tiny wires](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/science_innovation/06_virus_bateries.jsp) — an insight that could lead to cheap and biodegradable batteries and solar cells. Now she’s using the same virus to perform a different trick and solve a very different problem: the grim prognosis for women with ovarian cancer.

Today when surgeons remove ovarian tumors, they do it by eye. It is an inexact procedure called “debulking,” which can be as devastating as it sounds: the doctors sometimes need to remove parts of a woman’s colon, bladder, and other organs. Even so, they often miss small tumors that seed the cancer’s recurrence. That’s a large reason why ovarian cancer has [one of the lowest survival rates](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html). Fewer than half of the women who develop it survive more than five years.


That’s where Belcher’s system comes in. She’s come up with a way for doctors to see even the tiniest cancer cells on a screen, in real time, during the procedure. She’s done this by tuning that virus so that it binds to and lights up tumor cells that have spread beyond the ovaries.

Mice that underwent surgery with Belcher’s approach lived 40 percent longer. That’s a big deal. Michael Birrer, who is head of the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center in Alabama and worked with Belcher when he was at Massachusetts General Hospital, thinks the success in mice will translate well into people. While no formal application has been filed with the Food and Drug Administration, Birrer says he has been talking to agency staff about gaining approval to try the approach in women. “I think for ovarian cancer, it’s close to prime time,” Birrer says.

Unfortunately, Belcher’s technique can address only one of the reasons ovarian cancer is so deadly, which is that often it’s detected too late, after it’s already spread too far. At least for now, her technology is not able to detect cancer in the first place. Instead it’s about improving the prognosis for women who have surgery.

For the original application of this technology—making a virus churn out wires for batteries and solar cells—Belcher tweaked its DNA so it would bind to semiconductor particles. For the cancer probe, she engineered the viral DNA so it does something different: it expresses proteins that bind both to carbon nanotubes and to proteins produced by cancerous cells.

![](1*xjIEK5V2oQPWCO1XotjUHg.png)

First the virus is put into a solution containing nanotubes so they attach to each other. Then this combined virus-nanotube payload is injected into the body. There it will attach to cancerous cells and avoid healthy ones because they don’t produce the target proteins. As for the nanotubes, they will fluoresce when hit by infrared light, so when an infrared camera takes a picture of the tissue, the glow of the nanotubes marks the locations of the tumors.

In a recent talk at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Belcher showed a slide with scans of two lab mice. One scan, on a cancer-free mouse, was black; the other was studded with spots of light — tumor cells that a surgeon working without Belcher’s virus-nanotube probes had missed. Belcher says that after getting mice to live 40 percent longer after the ovarian cancer surgery, “I was excited and said ‘good job’ to my students. But I want it to be 80 percent.”

The findings have not yet been published, but they’ve been submitted to a journal and are under review.

### **The outsider**

Belcher’s work in biomedical engineering is part of a promising trend. As she points out, “I’m not a real biologist.” Typically, engineering and medicine “have been kind of separate cultures,” says Stephen Boppart, who directs the [Center for Optical Molecular Imaging](http://biophotonics.illinois.edu/?q=gsk-center-information) at the University of Illinois. “We are seeing more and more engineers and data scientists starting to apply their skills and talents and problem-solving abilities to problems in medicine and to health care,” Boppart says.

Prior to joining MIT’s [Marble Center for Cancer Nanoscience](http://nanomedicine.mit.edu/people/meet-marble-center-cancer-nanomedicine-faculty#Belcher), Belcher, 50, worked in energy and nanomaterials. A shelf behind her office desk contains a collection of seashells and chunky calcium carbonite crystals. Those natural materials offered clues that led to her success in building new materials from scratch. She did her Ph.D. research on how abalones grow complex and strong shells by producing proteins that meld with ingredients found in seawater.
> # “The surgeons were skeptical of the molecular stuff.”

When she first considered applying her ideas in biomedicine, “I wasn’t sure I could contribute, and I didn’t want to take up the space,” she says. “But my collaborators convinced me that this is a good disease to work on.”

Birrer, the oncologist in Alabama, says Belcher’s outsider perspective was crucial. “When we first proposed this, everyone said surgery and ovarian cancer had been talked about for a long time and there’s not a lot we can do to change it,” he says. “The surgeons were skeptical of the molecular stuff.”

Belcher also still does energy research, engineering viruses to generate materials that could be used as part of low-carbon energy systems. She teaches, [promotes science in grade schools](https://pk12.mit.edu/activities/), and tends to two boys whom she describes as her “favorite biomaterials.” But the ovarian cancer research is not just a one-off. She’s working on improving the efficiency of the technology, extending it to other kinds of cancer, and possibly developing a diagnostic tool or screening tool for high-risk women in the future.

“I don’t have the answer,” she says. “But I have the commitment.”

# Bringing Back the Woolly Mammoth Has Already Had an Unintended Consequence

## **Bringing Back the Woolly Mammoth Has Already Had an Unintended Consequence**

### But it’s positive.

There has been no shortage of buzz about George Church’s work to bring back the woolly mammoth using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing. It has been the subject of articles and [books](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/103411.De_Extinction_Science) and soon will be in a feature film. But well before we learn whether Church’s team can pull off the feat, they’ve already produced a surprising unintended consequence. They could save some of today’s endangered elephants from following their hairy cousins into extinction.

In order to reverse the extinction of the mammoth, the scientists need to edit cells from a fairly close living relative, Asian elephants. When Church’s team looked into elephant biology, they learned that a strain of herpes — called elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus*, *or EEHV — is killing young calves in captivity and in the wild. EEHV is the leading cause of death for captive elephants between ages 1 and 8 in North America and Europe. More than a dozen cases of infection have been identified in India, Thailand, and Cambodia, but the incidence could be even higher, as it can be difficult to monitor infections in the wild, where the number of Asian elephants has been [cut in half](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/elephants/asian_elephants/) in the past century. Unlike in humans, herpes kills young elephants within a few days to a week. Once in the bloodstream it starts breaking blood vessels, causing organs to bleed until the hemorrhaging turns fatal.

Virologist Paul Ling directs a leading research center for EEHV at Baylor College of Medicine. He and his colleagues monitor elephants at the neighboring Houston Zoo on a weekly basis by looking for viral particles in their blood and trunk mucous. If discovered early enough, it can be treated with antiviral drugs. Not all treatments are successful, so they’re looking to develop a vaccine. Ling has sequenced the genome of one strain, EEHV1, the one causing 90 percent of the elephant deaths. But development of a vaccine could be accelerated if scientists can culture it — get it to replicate — in a lab so they can better study how EEHV1 makes elephants susceptible to it. That work had not yet happened, though, until Church’s team followed their interest in de-extinction right to Ling’s lab door.

Bobby Dhadwar, a post-doctoral researcher in Church’s lab, is assembling EEHV1 particles that Ling gave him from infected elephants in order to culture it in the lab. The assembly is nearly completed. If he can get the virus to culture in a dish, he’ll use CRISPR-Cas9 to modify it. The change he wants to make: disable the genes that create proteins that lead to infection. Elephants could then be inoculated with a dose of this doctored virus, if proven safe.

Ling has his eye on other approaches for treatment as well, but if anyone cultures the virus, “it would be fantastic,” he says. He’d be able to use cells in a dish to assess the effectiveness of different herpes drugs and vaccines directly rather than relying on indirect tests in elephants.

Dhadwar, meanwhile, is already looking beyond the zoo and investigating similar CRISPR-Cas9 possibilities for the human herpes virus, which affects billions worldwide. He chalks the new direction in the Church lab up to a fortunate surprise: “Without the woolly mammoth work and the de-extinction work, I would not be doing this. It wouldn’t have crossed my desk at all.”

# Makers of the World, Unite

## Cory Doctorow’s novel “Walkaway” envisions a future in which the jobless masses co-opt automation technologies to ensure their freedom.

![Photograph by [Ben Zank](http://www.benzank.com/)](1*fbgI_IFhMNnQpgCMtILg_w.jpeg)*Photograph by [Ben Zank](http://www.benzank.com/)*

What happens when technology becomes so efficient that the vast majority of people become unnecessary as workers? Would the 99% become people of leisure? Would competition for jobs intensify, widening the gulf of inequality?

Cory Doctorow’s novel *Walkaway* imagines a future where the wealthy have created an economy of artificial scarcity, leaving billions scrambling for jobs and going into extreme debt just to get their kids through high school. At the same time, though, people in this imagined future have another option, thanks to the fact that they can use highly versatile and efficient manufacturing technology to form self-sustaining cooperative communes. To join one, a person simply has to decide to leave the capitalist “default” world — that is, to walk away.

The novel follows three disillusioned 20-somethings — an heiress, a snarkster, and a guy whose parents saddled him with all of the top 20 names for boys from the 1890 census (Hubert, Cecil, Ollie, etc.) — as they walk away from the late 21st century’s default society, fall in love with veteran walkaways, and become embroiled in the walkaways’ struggle against “zotta-rich” robber barons. The “zottas” harass and vilify the walkaways, while simultaneously restricting their access to education and resources under the guise of meritocracy.

![](1*DF1b12H-bC3nMBhopL6HXA.png)

[Doctorow](http://craphound.com/bio/) — who is the co-editor of BoingBoing, a longtime Internet personality, and the sort of person who can [get Ed Snowden to write blurbs ](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15547314/edward-snowden-cory-doctorow-nypl-talk-walkaway)for his book jackets — puts forward loads of interesting ideas about the future of technology and media and explores the ways that human psychology sometimes keeps us from living up to our ideals.

Though it’s set in a world where wealthy elites aggressively enforce their own supremacy, *Walkaway* is very much a utopian novel, more in line with Aldous Huxley’s *Island* than *Brave New World.* *Walkaway* plays with the idea that technologies that would be horrifying in the hands of a militaristic state or an insatiable oligarchy could be transformative and liberating if shared freely and equitably. For example, extensive data networks can be used to altruistically share information and ideas or to surveil and sic deadly drones on enemies. At times, the vein of hope running through *Walkaway* verges on unearned optimism (in a world nominally wracked by “Old Man Climate Change” no one ever seems to have a problem accessing water), but given the current glut of dystopian and post-apocalyptic novels that depict human nature as ruthlessly self-centered and violent, the optimism is refreshing. The main characters are mostly people of color and LGBTQ, and eventually they band together as a very non-traditional family unit.

But it’s clear that the characters are meant to take a back seat to the real star: walkaway culture itself. The walkaways are makers, collaborating to build communal homes from scavenged parts, presumably through advanced 3-D printing (we don’t get many descriptions of the printers, how they work, or what their limitations are). The self-governance of the walkaway camps is very Reddit-on-a-good-day, where everyone makes design suggestions and reaches a consensus through discussion. The book is steeped in the sort of slang and debates you’d hear around the MIT Media Lab.

The most memorable aspect of the story is a tech development race. Both the “zotta-rich” tycoons of default and the researchers at “Walkaway U” are working on technology that enables a form of digital immortality. The walkaways plan to distribute this tech as open-source software. Anyone who can build a brain scanner and cobble together enough computing power to run a simulation of a deceased friend would be able to grant that person a form of life after death. This is a scenario that the zottas desperately want to prevent; they would rather restrict access to the technology and choose only to immortalize themselves and paying customers. Their motive is not just to capture profits from the technology; the prospect of leaderless, moneyless, crowd-sourcing communes developing technology more powerful than the products of the default economic system poses an existential threat to the idea that the leaders of that system attained their position through merit alone and thus deserve to control life and death. If cooperation can beat relentless capitalistic competition at its own game and achieve technological immortality first, why would anyone continue to believe that a competitive, predatory system is the best way to advance human knowledge and wellbeing? That’s an argument you actually see today on Internet forums devoted to bitcoin, blockchain, and citizen science.
> # Anyone who can build a brain scanner and cobble together enough computing power to run a simulation of a deceased friend would be able to grant that person a form of life after death.

I enjoyed the way Doctorow takes today’s Internet slang and gives it slight twists that subvert the meaning. When these characters speak of “special snowflakes,” they aren’t denigrating the easily offended; instead, the “special snowflake” of *Walkaway* is someone who has bought into default society’s toxic notion that the elites earned their position solely by merit. The characters most frequently wield the term not against rivals but against themselves, as a way of resisting the temptation to keep score.

The zottas take what they want and program their self-driving stretch limos to speed and weave through traffic, believing that if they don’t game the system, someone else will, at their expense. “Exploit others before they exploit you” becomes their foundational virtue. As one character describes a zotta: “His whole identity rests on the idea that the system is legit and that he earned his position in it fair and square and everyone else is a whiner.”

But those so-called whiners develop real power in Doctorow’s imagined utopia, as technologies developed by the capitalist system are repurposed by the cooperative masses to reveal the system’s hypocrisy.

# This is Your Brain on Weed

## Pot is being packaged like fine wines and sold with bold claims about physical and psychological benefits. Does science back up the marketing pitch?

![Illustration by Graham Roumieu](1*8Bz__Xqv8k_MDxOS5STfuQ.jpeg)*Illustration by Graham Roumieu*

I n the back yard of the Wu Wei Tea Temple, a café in Fairfax, California, Brant Hindman, operations director of a new cannabis social club, [HerbaBuena](http://herbabuena.com/), held court with patrons in their 40s and 50s on a Saturday afternoon. He stood behind a table filled with biodynamic, sun-grown cannabis flowers on display under glass bell jars, each with a description written like wine-tasting notes on fancy cards: “amazing balance of THC to CDB,” “pain-easing” and “bright high.”

Hindman, tall with a shaved head, laughed and half jokingly called himself a “sensimelier” as he advised the club’s members toward the flower “with fruit in the terpenes” or the one with “a more earthly, marigold nose.”

“When your brain is somehow deficient in some kind of cannabinoid, when you smell it or taste it, you’ll get a sense of whether it’s the right cannabinoid for you or not,” he said. “Say, you’re leaning towards ‘Ooh, tangy, this is the right thing for me. It works for my anxiety.’ If your body leans in or leans out, you’ll get a good sense of whether it’s the right strain for you.”

This is a new way of selling pot. Not only is the artisanal texture of HerbaBuena’s spiel familiar to wine aficionados, it’s also sprinkled with claims that certain chemical compounds in the plant — especially cannabidiol, or CBD — are just what your body needs for improving your sleep, your mood and other aspects of your health. Yes, this sounds like what you’ve heard medicinal marijuana advocates touting for decades. But new research is beginning to support the idea that CBD is a key and underappreciated ingredient.

What makes CBD particularly intriguing as a potential health aid is that it doesn’t get you high. That effect primarily comes from THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. But while CBD can be distilled from pot, it’s not considered as effective when isolated from the other chemicals in the plant. (This is known as the [“entourage effect.”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165946)) So growers are developing strains with higher CBD-to-THC ratios — and businesses like HerbaBuena are walking people through these new choices.

![**Some of HerbaBuena’s products, including pot that is high in CBD.** (Courtesy of Alicia Rose)](1*L9jLRIbofOgIsQP-2Xjsqg.jpeg)***Some of HerbaBuena’s products, including pot that is high in CBD.** (Courtesy of Alicia Rose)*

Wearing a belted sun dress, HerbaBuena founder Alicia Rose brushed her long honey brown hair back before leaning over a display of products inside the tea house, including micro-dosing tinctures, CBD-heavy chocolates and dried fruit edibles. She described the alchemy and effects of her different products to new members of the social club who sat along a counter. One member, Laura Bailey, told Rose that she had problems falling asleep. “Then you’ll want to keep this right by your bed,” Rose said, holding a small medicine jar with a dropper. “Along with organically grown cannabis, it has passionflower, hops, flower and gemstone essences, along with glycerin.”

“I think I also want to take this before yoga class,” Bailey responded. She held up a box of [OARA CBD chocolates](http://herbabuena.com/product/oara-dark-chocolate-cbd/). The label announced “hand poured, couverture dark chocolate, infused with biodynamic sun-grown cannabis and a daily probiotic.”

“That’s a good choice,” Rose said.

It’s no accident that HerbaBuena’s potions, blends, tinctures, patches, gels and even sprays for pets that suffer from anxiety are beautifully packaged like high-end wine or gourmet food. Rose was raised on a farm in New York by hippie parents who grew their own marijuana, but she spent the last 15 years as a marketing and branding consultant at boutique California wineries. And just as most people don’t buy a high-end Napa Cabernet to get drunk, she’s predicting that many adults want the medical benefits of cannabis without intense highs.

The science behind the chemical compounds in cannabis is far more complex than in wine and still emerging. But studies at Harvard Medical School have indicated that CBD might improve some people’s ability to solve problems in addition to improving sleep and overall quality of life.

Much of this research has come from Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard who has been studying the effects of cannabis for about two decades and founded Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery (MIND) at McLean Hospital. Gruber and other researchers have found that when kids use cannabis prior to age 16, when their brains are still developing and more vulnerable, [it can have](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24190588) detrimental effects such as attention deficits, lower IQ scores and increased impulsivity. Perhaps tellingly, the cannabis smoked by young people is often developed for maximum psychoactive impact, so it contains very high levels of THC. In a study entitled [“Splendor in the Grass?”](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphar.2016.00355/) she and her colleagues noted that THC levels in recreational marijuana rose from 4 percent to 12 percent between 1995 and 2014 while CBD levels in some strains were barely perceptible.

But Gruber has found very different results with adults who used medical cannabis that often had a higher ratio of CBD to THC. In one study, 11 medical marijuana users between the ages of 32 and 75 exhibited improvement on tasks mediated by the frontal cortex, which is responsible for problem solving. She says those results are holding up in experiments with larger sample sizes. And her team is finding that other cannabinoids, such as cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabigerol (CBG), deserve further examination as possible treatments for a wide range of ailments.
> # “This will be so very, very mild that my 81-year-old mother is looking forward to it.”

The field has come a long way since Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, an Israeli biochemist, first discovered THC in the 1960s and then identified the endocannabinoid system — naturally occurring receptors for cannabis-like compounds our bodies naturally produce. One such compound found in the brain is anandamide. It’s been called “the bliss molecule” and [appears to be stimulated](https://news.uci.edu/research/love-hormone-helps-produce-bliss-molecules-to-boost-pleasure-of-social-interactions/) by oxytocin, the “love hormone.” Julie Holland, a psychiatrist and the author of *The Pot Book*, calls anandamide “a molecule of resilience that helps you bounce back from stress.” And it follows, then, that “cannabinoids from the plant can augment the naturally occurring ones in our systems,” she says.

How does this work, exactly? Gregory Gerdeman, a neuroscientist at Eckerd College in Florida who wrote his dissertation on cannabis pharmacology, says endocannabinoids are like surge protectors for cells, [helping to modulate their levels of electricity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18776886). Crucially, these receptors are found throughout the body, not only in the brain but also in the muscular, immune and reproductive systems. That’s why marijuana [has shown promise for treating such a wide array of problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202504/) from depression and anorexia to Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis.

Gerdeman hopes that cannabis research will eventually make it possible to isolate the different molecules in cannabis that best target the endocannabinoid system to treat specific illnesses. But for now this is still a bit of a guessing game on the part of cannabis farmers and lab scientists who are working with producers such as [Kikoko Teas](https://kikoko.com/), founded in Sausalito, California, by Jennifer Chapin and Amanda Jones. This spring they are launching customized cannabis herbal teas. One called “Sympa-Tea,” a ginger-orange blend, has 20 milligrams of CBD and 3 of THC per tea bag. It’s intended to be used as a pain reliever.

Jones said that until recently, dispensaries wouldn’t be interested in these teas because of the low dosage of THC, but that’s beginning to change. “We are working on a tea that’s 80 parts CBD to 2 parts THC,” she says. “This will be so very, very mild that my 81-year-old mother is looking forward to it.”

# 5 Films About the Neobiological Revolution to Put in Your Queue

## Get inspired by documentaries on food, human performance, and more.

![Illustration by Nick Vokey](1*YDhxUPHGl-JFUjnGQFv63A.jpeg)*Illustration by Nick Vokey*

Coming up with [fresh dispatches from the frontiers](https://medium.com/neodotlife/congratulations-you-made-it-89858919d504) of science and technology leads us to read and read and read, all day, every day. But often you’ve just got to see something to truly get it. In that spirit, here are some particularly intriguing documentaries from the past couple of years.

### [*Food Evolution* (2017)](https://www.foodevolutionmovie.com/)

This documentary unravels misconceptions surrounding genetically modified crops. To name one: “GMO” does not necessarily equal “Monsanto” or any other huge company. The film also drives home the fact that GMO opponents often don’t make much sense. As if to confirm that point, 48 people affiliated with UC Berkeley [wrote an open letter criticizing](https://foodfirst.org/response-to-uc-berkeley-early-screening-of-food-evolution/) the movie because, among other things, it involves Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, who are “well-known as boosters for biotech solutions to food insecurity.” Like that’s a bad thing! Feeding 10 billion people in a world stressed by pollution and climate change calls for more biotech solutions, not fewer. *Food Evolution* helps make the point that such technologies can be deployed responsibly, if we can just get on with it.

(Bonus film on this subject: [a Dutch documentary called *Well Fed](https://vimeo.com/188913344)*.)


### [Take Your Pills (2018)](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117831)

“Every generation has found a different way to try to enhance their performance,” author Alan Schwarz says in this film. For a surprising number of students and young athletes, the method of choice is to take amphetamines like Adderall. Do these addictive stimulants work as well as people think—or do they inspire a false confidence?


### [Breaking2 (2017)](https://youtu.be/V2ZLG-Fij_4)

No one has run a marathon in less than two hours. Is it physically impossible? Or can people who are already at the peak of human performance wring just a little bit more out of their bodies and minds? *National Geographic* beautifully chronicles three of the world’s best long-distance runners plotting with physiologists to stretch the limits.


### [Unrest (2017)](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80168300?trackId=14277281&tctx=0%2C0%2C295b3bef-381a-4700-b8fd-9d72daf0ba3e-23870793%2C%2C)

It’s so intimate that it’s hard to watch at times, but this is a remarkable investigation of myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Working much of the time from her own bed after being hit hard by the disease, director Jennifer Brea explores its mysterious viral origins and captures both the exasperation and the resilience of fellow patients around the world.


### [Gut Hack (2017)](https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000005015342/gut-hack.html)

You viscerally feel the personal stakes of biohacking in this short film about Josiah Zayner’s self-administered fecal transplant.

# The Children You Could Have Produced Instead

## The Children You Could Have Produced Instead

### Technology will dramatically increase the choices that parents can make about their offspring. But having too many options can be a bad thing.

I f you haven’t heard of embryo freezing, you should know that hundreds of thousands of people around you have been booted up from cold storage. They were immobilized at -196 degrees Celsius, sometimes for years, before they were thawed out and injected into a warm womb and they grew into a person.

Why do people freeze embryos? Fertility problems are the most common reason. By producing a surfeit of high-quality embryos through in-vitro fertilization and freezing them, one has “backups” and doesn’t have to start the process from scratch. And there are other reasons. Imagine you’re in the Army and about to go off to a war, and facing death inspires you to leave the possibility of babies with your partner. Or imagine you’re a couple with big careers that can’t be put on hold, and you want to stop the clock of your youthful genetics.

Embryo freezing has become increasingly popular; among other factors, it beats egg freezing. Few eggs survive freezing and thawing, mostly because of ice crystals — but embryos that have developed for a few days are significantly larger and tougher. Some parents have returned after more than a decade, thawed an embryo, and given birth to a perfectly healthy baby. It is thought that an embryo living in a liquid nitrogen world could be viable indefinitely. They are dormant possibility.

This reproductive technology is a triumph of science, but it has the potential to revise the typical sequences of parenthood: what if a couple freezes their embryos, and then “has” their child when they’re 70 years old, after doing everything they’ve wanted to do? And because I am a neuroscientist, embryo freezing makes me wonder about the issue of regret.

Say you have eight frozen embryos. You can use genetic testing to discover what diseases are expected in each embryo, and then select the one with the fewest health risks. This is great news for your child’s future. But there’s no real reason to stop there: after all, genetic testing grows more discerning each year. Which eye color would you like? How tall is each embryo expected to be? Which one will grow into the most muscular athlete? What will each embryo look like a few decades from now — and why shouldn’t you choose the most attractive one? All those options will give us more choice about our children than any previous generation ever dreamt.

That’s great, right? Maybe not. Put aside the concern that biological diversity will decrease as certain traits win out; instead, I want to address a psychological point. Parents generally have operated by a simple principle: we get the kids we get. They are the cards we’re dealt.

But in the near future, many parents will be able to say “I choose number 5” instead of “I choose number 7.” Parental brains will wrestle with questions they have never before faced in reproduction. Their children will share a bedroom with the *what-if *ghosts of the other children that could have taken his or her place.

![(Photo by Marla Aufmuth)](1*1ZWLQD2y_yW5b2izIIbGow.jpeg)*(Photo by Marla Aufmuth)*

So while choosing embryos seems like a good move for lowering the disease burden of the next generation, it promises to alter the psychology of parenting. How? Because of what’s sometimes called the paradox of choice: the more options you have, the less satisfied you’ll be. This has been demonstrated in countless scenarios. Imagine you enter a store that offers dozens of flavors of ice cream. After you’ve made your choice, you’ll enjoy your cone — but it turns out you would have enjoyed the same one even *more* if there were fewer choices, or no choice at all. This same effect is seen in studies from appliances to cars to mates.

Embryo choosing, therefore, offers a new opportunity for regret: a disappointment about active choices we have made (“I’ll choose number 3”) rather than the single, passive outcome we’re used to (“here’s your new baby!”). When your child throws a temper tantrum, lying down in the store aisle and kicking the floor, a thought may flit through your consciousness: what if I had chosen embryo number 4 instead? Let’s be clear that embryo number 4 would not be free of tantrums. But the brain’s capacity to simulate *what ifs* would set you wondering.

Or say you selected embryo 5, believing it was free of genetic risk — only to later discover a problem that was undetectable at the time. And embryo 2, which you passed over, would have avoided this outcome … had you only chosen differently.
> # The more options you have, the less satisfied you’ll be.

Why does having more choice lead to more regret? It’s because the brain chronically simulates possible futures. You can’t help this; it happens under the hood, without your awareness. The brain doesn’t live in real time: it constantly simulates from *what-is *to *what-could-be*. And it spends much of its time simulating *what-could-have-been*: the world that would have existed had you made different choices. Such fictive outcomes are compared against actual outcomes — and the difference is experienced as regret or relief. This is one way we learn: we use the signals of regret and relief to update our models of the world, and this helps us navigate our choices the next time a similar situation arises.

In the 1950s, psychologist Herbert Simon pointed out that many of us act as “maximizers” — that is, we want to make sure we always make the best possible choice. Unfortunately, as the number of options increases, it becomes ever more difficult to know that we’ve made the optimal pick. It is theorized that much of modern anxiety comes from the increased opportunities for selection, at the cost of happiness.

When it comes to offspring, we have always had a simplicity born of choicelessness. Now, more and more couples will opt out of that. This is not to say we shouldn’t build more choice into our lives; in this case, it will allow us to birth generations with less disease. But when things that were formerly out of our control become within our control, we’ll have to be poised for a somewhat different emotional world: one with the peculiar juxtaposition of more healthy, beautiful children, and more parental remorse.

# Neurotribe Finds Promised Land

## Ultra Testing shows that autism in the workplace can be a feature, not a bug.

![](1*Avla-k40SDZaXC3w4S-fDQ.png)

The producers of the Webby awards recently hired a small company called [Ultra Testing](http://www.ultratesting.us/) to examine their website for bugs. The Ultra team identified 20 percent more issues than the previous testers had, including glitches that arose when the site ran on different browsers. They delivered “a level of quality assurance that I have never seen in my 14 years of Web development,” says Steve Marchese, the executive producer of the Webby awards.

What makes Ultra Testing different from the many other companies that perform quality checks on websites and software programs is that most of its testers are on the autism spectrum.

Some individuals on the spectrum excel at pattern recognition and work with laser-like focus, says Lynda Geller, a clinical psychologist who has at least one former patient now employed at Ultra. “They tend to become intensely fixated on certain topics, and if they’re fixated on computer use they can be extra valuable to a company,” she says. For some projects, Ultra employees come up with test cases for how an application or website is used, and then work through these cases, either manually or with automated scripts, in search of bugs. For other projects, they may inspect clients’ code directly. Projects can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to several years.

Ultra Testing was founded on the premise that hiring people on the autism spectrum and supporting other kinds of [neurodiversity](http://stevesilberman.com/book/neurotribes/) can give companies a competitive advantage, rather than simply being a good deed. Art Shectman, who co-founded the company in 2013, says that Ultra is trying to provide a model of success for other for-profit companies to emulate.

Over the next 10 years, an estimated half million people with autism will reach adulthood. Yet the unemployment rate for people on the spectrum is estimated to be as high as 85 percent—which is higher than the figure for individuals with learning disabilities or various forms of emotional disturbance. For those who do find work, it is often low-skilled; only 35 percent of 18-year-olds on the spectrum go to college.

For Ultra, addressing this problem meant rethinking the hiring process, which tends to be a barrier for individuals on the spectrum. It also meant creating a novel company culture, in which rules and expectations are codified to an unusual degree, with the goal of making people on the spectrum comfortable and enabling them to thrive.
> # The unemployment rate for people on the spectrum is estimated to be as high as 85 percent.

The differences begin with job interviews. Interviews at many companies disadvantage people who struggle with social interaction, unnecessarily cutting off a great deal of talent. “Most research says that the interview process is baloney,” Shectman says. Even among autistic people with college degrees, many have “lousy resumes,” with little work history, he says. So Ultra created an alternative screening process, which does not require resumes or cover letters. Instead Ultra uses questionnaires, essays, and tests, which are conducted remotely, to suss out candidates with particular skills, like pattern recognition, as well as certain behavioral traits, like “coachability” and perseverance.

Later in the recruitment process, when the company does conduct interviews, they are highly structured, including questions like “have you recently learned a new technical software application or tool?” The process culminates in a week-long class that simulates work. A high percentage of the candidates who complete the class go on to join the company.

Identifying skillful software testers is only the first step. “There’s this myth that if you just get autistics in the door,” they will manage in the workplace, says Marcelle Ciampi, who is Ultra’s community manager, leads recruitment, and is herself on the spectrum. “But they still need to be themselves once they’re hired.” So the company has developed a set of tools aimed at making the work environment, including other people in it, easier for staffers to decipher. Employees create personal “user manuals,” which colleagues are encouraged to consult, particularly at the start of new projects. These guides describe the learning styles they prefer, the triggers that impede them, and the ways that supervisors and colleagues can help. One employee notes, for instance, that “sudden changes in schedule” and “being the focus of attention” are problematic. He also says that supervisors can help by remembering: “I don’t have the best social skills, so if I seem rude I didn’t mean to.”

Employees at Ultra typically work remotely and communicate over email or Slack. This means they can process information with a lag, rather than in real time. But even during virtual meetings, “we can choose to keep our faces hidden,” says Ciampi. (That’s a preference she has specified in her personal user manual. She also notes that she has dyslexia and dysgraphia — a writing disability — and wants colleagues to know that when they see typos in her emails, “I’m not being careless. I might have spent an hour editing, I just didn’t see it.”)

In addition to helping employees decipher each other’s needs, Ultra attempts to codify workplace conventions that non-autistic employees might find easier to intuit. “We find that writing down the unwritten roles, all the tribal and folklore knowledge in the company, is critical,” says Shectman.** **For instance, because some autistic people tend to elaborate too much, Ultra advises employees to write their emails in fewer than 700 characters and seven sentences. If an interaction with a client continues for more than two back-and-forth exchanges, employees are instructed to tell a supervisor, since it may be that there’s an underlying issue that the employee is just not picking up on.
> # Ultra Testing says that when it assessed the digital platform of a financial services company it detected 56 percent more bugs than the previous group of testers.

Autistic people navigating the world are sometimes described as trying to understand a foreign culture. Temple Grandin said she was like “an anthropologist on Mars,” (which became the title of Oliver Sacks’ profile of her). The autism advocate Jim Sinclair once described himself, in an essay, as “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual.” For its part, Ultra addresses this sense of disorientation head-on, providing its employees with codified descriptions — sometimes verging on algorithmic instructions — for handling clients, colleagues, and other aspects of the working world.

The result is a company that appears to be thriving. In 2013, Ultra had two clients and five employees. By last year, the client list had grown to 45, and the company employed over 50 individuals, with roughly 75 percent of them on the autism spectrum. Ultra’s revenue is on track to double in 2017, according to its founders.

If this success can help normalize the hiring of individuals on the spectrum, it could also lead to greater acceptance of the accommodations that make their employment fruitful. The broader neurodiversity movement emphasizes the strengths, rather than the deficits, of individuals on the spectrum. “They are socially different and need an environment that doesn’t harm them for being socially different,” says Geller. “It shouldn’t be that hard.” Other software companies, including Microsoft and SAP, have also developed programs for employees on the spectrum, suggesting an increased commitment to hiring and retaining them.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of Ultra’s success is the degree to which it has normalized work for the employees themselves. John Cha, 29, who started as a software tester in 2013, says it was his “first real job.”

Cha has developed expertise in testing digital platforms for their accessibility — that is, how usable they are for people who rely on a computer keyboard, rather than a mouse, to navigate, perhaps because they are visually impaired. In one project, Cha and his colleagues assessed the digital platform of a large financial services company and detected 56 percent more bugs than the previous group of testers, from IBM, had been able to do, according to Ultra Testing.

Now the fact of his employment has become routine for Cha. When asked whether he plans to stay on, he says, simply: “The work is interesting, and I like the people. As long as those two conditions apply, I will be here.”

# Young Biodesigners Unveil Clever Ideas for a Cleaner World

## Young Biodesigners Unveil Clever Ideas for a Cleaner World

### Student competitors turn jellyfish, microorganisms, and even hair cells into useful things.

A t the 2018 Biodesign Challenge Summit—part art opening, part science fair—students from around the world showed how living organisms can be building materials that make the planet a greener, healthier, more artful place. The projects were in various stages of development, some more conceptual than others. But as the contestants showed their stuff to teachers, friends, reporters, and judges at the Parsons School of Design in New York City, all of them had a palpable sense of idealism and possibility. Here are some highlights.

![](1*PQQt8ZtCXECL_bpZShty6g.jpeg)

![](1*768XULCSGcnt_8HmMUuAnA.png)

### Aerolis

These organic sculptures, from a team at Ghent University, purify urban air and are shaped by local conditions: they bend in the direction of strong wind. They are made of polymers seeded with the protein biotin, which binds to a range of microorganisms. These microorganisms, in turn, degrade volatile organic compounds and other pollutants. The sculptures are study enough to withstand wind and rain, which would make them ideal pieces of art near sewers, subway grates, and other public spaces.

![](1*PQQt8ZtCXECL_bpZShty6g.jpeg)

![](1*WKRDAI35pC54EZ-fSr6JVQ.png)

### Mycommunity Toilet

A group from the University of British Columbia [won the Biodesign Challenge](http://biodesignchallenge.org/summit-2018/) with a toilet that efficiently converts solid human waste into fertilizer. Its key element is a box tank made from mycelium, a mass of thread-like structures that fungi use to take in water and nutrients.

In the front is a green cup that funnels urine into a plastic jerrycan (since urine is usually sterile, it is easier to dispose of safely than feces). When someone poops into the mycelium tank, fungi and bacteria begin to convert it into compost. Individuals add sawdust or banana leaves after each use to keep the tank full of oxygen for the microorganisms to thrive. When the tank is full, it’s not necessary to dump its contents. Instead, it can be buried in the ground, where composting continues and the mycelium grows and provides nutrients for plants.

The team says Mycommunity Toilets might prove useful in refugee camps, where conflict frequently occurs around washroom facilities. Low-cost toilets that families could use closer to their living quarters might minimize the opportunity for crowded conditions to escalate into violence.

### Pulmo Plastic

As the oceans become warmer and more acidic, biodiversity declines and jellyfish proliferate. So a team from New York University offers a way to turn jellyfish into useful products: biodegradable plastics.

Jellyfish contain the structural protein collagen. Collagen can be converted to gelatin, which in turn can be mixed with vegetable glycerin to form materials that have some of the properties of plastic. The team intends for Pulmo Plastic to find use in bags, rings for six-packs and other disposable items.

![](1*FLcwlJDtwPwwEwFqAz606w.png)

### Mycterials

Much as the Mycommunity Toilet team uses mycelium as a structural material, other biotechnologists hope to use it to make walls and furniture. But how will they direct its growth? A group from the University of Edinburgh adds iron particles to mycelium and then controls and shapes it using magnets. They used a robotic arm at the Biodesign Challenge to show it’s possible to build with mycelium remotely.

### Kerasynth

A team from Maryland Institute College of Art plans to use tissue engineering to produce vegan wool for dresses, coats, and other garments. The wool fibers would be produced by hair-follicle germ cells embedded within collagen; a network of microfluidic channels would deliver nutrients and remove wastes from the cells. The students can produce small amounts of wool this way now, and this dress is an example of what the team hopes it can create down the road, using fibers harvested from this system.

### Plastomach

Living in this pouch, alongside the colorful bottle caps and parts of water bottles and laundry detergent containers, is pearl oyster fungus. It’s there because it has been shown to eat both low- and high-density polyethylene, common plastics that otherwise end up in landfills or in the ocean. The inventors of this “plastomach,” from Rutgers, cut the plastic into small pieces and embedded them in layers of wood chips and mulch, which were also used to nourish the fungus.

This system is able to break down only small amounts of plastic. However, the team argues that if every household had a plastomach, it might begin to make a dent in the plastic problem, while serving as a daily reminder to minimize plastic use. The system would be low maintenance, periodically requiring new wood chips and a spray of water. Harmless amounts of gases produced by the plastomach, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, are released from a vent in the top of the pouch.

# The Bugs that Give Wine Its Flavor

## The Bugs that Give Wine Its Flavor

### Can sequencing a vineyard’s microbiome make it possible to reverse engineer a fine wine?

For the uninitiated, wine talk can be puzzling. Oenophiles gush over hints of tobacco, pencil shavings, charred herbs, and loamy soil. It’s brawny, chewy, cedary, or raw. Whether these descriptions are perceptive or pretentious, they all get at something subtle and complex about wine, notably terroir: the idea that a wine’s characteristics are an expression of the place where the grapes grow.

Soil, climate, geology, topography, elevation, and local winemaking traditions and techniques all make a particular wine different from others made with the same grapes. But now scientists are finding another factor contributes to terroir: microbes.


Every winemaker already knows that microorganisms drive the fermentation process that turns grape juice into a potent potable. But they’ve had little insight into the thousand species of fungi, bacteria, and archaea that teem in the soil, on the vine and the fruit, and even in the cellar, forming communities known as microbiomes. In the soil, these microbes can alter how roots grow and absorb nutrients, which affects the quality of the grape. Although microbes are filtered out of the finished product you drink, they persist through the fermentation process, producing chemicals that taste of, say, vanilla or butter.

What most of these microbes do, exactly, is still a bit of a black box. But a San Francisco-based startup called Biome Makers wants to help growers and winemakers better understand how these critters affect their product. For $199 a pop, vintners can submit a sample of their soil, vine, grape, unfermented grape juice, or any other part of the fermentation process. By sequencing the microbial DNA, Biome Makers provides an analysis of the sample’s microbiome, giving growers a potentially powerful new way to manage their grapes and winemaking process.

“Now we have the possibility to understand the microbiome and the microbes of wine,” says Francisco De Frutos, the U.S. business development manager for Biome Makers. Researchers are still teasing out the details for how specific microbes affect wine, and even De Frutos admits that precise prediction and control is not yet possible. But someday, scientists’ understanding of the wine microbiome could allow for fine-grained manipulations of terroir.

![***Biome Makers can sequence the soil, vines, grapes, or fermented liquids from a vineyard to identify its microbiome. It plans to expand to other crops such as sugar cane, apples, and pecans. **(Photo courtesy of Biome Makers)*](1*ma-YBHwsKANCRMvSjYdltQ.jpeg)****Biome Makers can sequence the soil, vines, grapes, or fermented liquids from a vineyard to identify its microbiome. It plans to expand to other crops such as sugar cane, apples, and pecans. **(Photo courtesy of Biome Makers)**

The startup, founded in 2015, is part of a wave of companies trying to make better use of the microbiome for agriculture. Startups and big corporations such as Bayer think that manipulating microbes will boost crop yield and quality and help manage diseases. In one ambitious partnership, Bayer and a synthetic biology company, Ginkgo Bioworks, [are trying to engineer microbes](https://medium.com/neodotlife/6-things-to-watch-in-synthetic-biology-f76666c7114e) that will enable a wide variety of plants to get nitrogen from the air rather than requiring fertilizer. In March, Bayer established a new lab space for biotech startups, with Biome Makers as its first tenant. Startups such as Trace Genomics also sequence soil microbiomes to help growers ensure healthy soil. A company called MicroTrek samples microbes to monitor fermentation and spoilage during food and beverage production.

As part of its service, called WineSeq, Biome Makers provides a website that vintners can use to understand their wine microbes. The site identifies microbes that may muck up fermentation — an abundance of a bacterium that produces acetic acid, for example, leading to an overpowering taste of vinegar. The company also flags pathogenic microbes that could cause diseases on the vines.

Then there’s terroir. Researchers [have found](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/1/E139) that grape microbiomes in California’s Napa and Sonoma counties depend on the type of grape, where it’s grown, and the climate. They have also [linked](http://mbio.asm.org/content/7/3/e00631-16) variations in grape microbiomes and the chemical composition of wine to specific vineyards in Napa. Scientists have also [discovered](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14233) that certain strains of *S. cerevisiae*, the primary yeast that ferments wine, vary from region to region in New Zealand. Biome Makers can identify a few specific yeasts that it says have been linked to certain flavors, such as a zinfandel’s body and its spicy, floral, or earthy qualities.

![***Left: The front end of Biome Makers’ vineyard sequencing app, which can include sample results, diseases, treatments, and microbiome diversity.

Right: The raw data.** (Photo courtesy of Biome Makers)**

Still, these types of studies only highlight correlations between microbiomes and particular locales and soils. Microbes produce lots of chemicals, and they likely interact with one another in myriad ways. Identifying cause-and-effect connections between specific microbes and the aromas of a riesling is not yet something scientists can do, let alone predicting or even manipulating a microbe’s influence on wine.

“Microbial terroir is a measurable thing; it’s just that understanding the implications of that are challenging at this point,” says Reid Griggs, a graduate student in enology at the University of California, Davis.

Griggs says he doesn’t know Biome Makers’ exact methods, but he’s skeptical that identifying a few bugs can really predict flavor. So much of fermentation, for instance, depends on environment. “The same yeast in two different juices is going to produce two different wines,” he says. Standard sequencing techniques also don’t provide a complete picture of all the compounds a microbe can produce. For a winemaker, he says, applications of sequencing technology at this point might not go much beyond identifying pathogens that could cause disease in grapevines.

But despite the uncertainty so far, some winemakers are already recognizing the potential of the wine microbiome, says Jean Michel Valette, the CEO of Vinfolio, and the former CEO of Franciscan Estate Winery and managing director of Robert Mondavi Winery. “We don’t always know what to look for, or what to look at,” he says. “But we know we need to be looking.”

Identifying microbes may be especially useful for people like David Olson, owner of Sustainable Growing Solutions in California and one of Biome Makers’ clients. Olson’s company, founded in 2013, sells diverse microbial communities — nurtured in rich compost, for example — that go into irrigation systems to help crops grow better. A third of his customers are wine-grape growers. But no one really knows how Olson’s products work. Enter Biome Makers: it was able to identify the microbes that produce certain compounds that help the vine grow.

Olson says the data he gets from Biome Makers helps him choose the best mix of bugs for a particular crop. “It gives us a quantitative tool we just didn’t have before,” Olson says.

For wine tasters, microbiome analyses might someday provide yet more complexity — and verbiage. If those notes of blueberry and black pepper weren’t subtle enough, you might bring up the full body and spicy, vegetal undertones of *M. pulcherrima* and *H. uvarum*.

# Keep Running, Never Get Over the Hill

## Elite athletes are now maintaining their level of performance in their 40s and beyond. What can they teach the rest of us?

![**Kristin Armstrong, then 43 years old, shows her son the gold medal she won in cycling at the 2016 Olympics.** (Photo by Bryn Lennon/Getty Images)](1*mru5mYasxgaPJ092RsGbjw.jpeg)***Kristin Armstrong, then 43 years old, shows her son the gold medal she won in cycling at the 2016 Olympics.** (Photo by Bryn Lennon/Getty Images)*

A s an athlete on the precipice of my 40th birthday, I’ve been dogged by the questions that Jeff Bercovici raises in [*Play On](https://www.amazon.com/Play-New-Science-Elite-Performance/dp/054480998X?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=neodotlife-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=79a7bb2cb6317bc23e8d8a1fc3135615&camp=1789&creative=9325): The New Science of Elite Performance at Any Age*. I bike every day, practice yoga, and run six to eight miles a couple of times a week. Last year I experienced hamstring pulls, calf pulls, Achilles tendon pain, and an ankle injury that drove me to start swimming in order to reduce the load on my aching legs. Does this increasing rate of injury mean that I’m starting a slow decline into senescence? Or does it indicate that I just need to train differently?

Bercovici’s book argues that it’s the latter. In almost every sport, he writes, “athletes are sticking around for an extra victory lap or three, rather than shuffling off to the metaphorical showers at the first sign of gray.” He has ample examples for inspiration. Peyton Manning and Tom Brady were 39 when they became the oldest quarterbacks to win Super Bowls. Cyclist Kristin Armstrong turned 43 in Rio in 2016 and became the first Olympian ever to win gold three times in the same cycling event. Every year, the big-wave surfers at the legendary Mavericks competition get a bit grayer, with half of the top finishers older than 40. Runners of all distances are reaching peaks later in their careers. The trend is most pronounced in tennis, where the average age of tournament winners was 24 in 2006. By 2016, it had jumped to 29, and the number of tournament champions over 30 increased from zero to 14. Serena Williams was 34 when she became the oldest woman ever to win a Grand Slam tournament, and she later revealed that she had been pregnant at the time.


These superheroes work out insanely hard, and they’ve sacrificed much in their lives to maintain lifestyles with optimal nutrition and self-care. They also have coaches and researchers designing their training programs. But in Bercovici’s book, he is the real protagonist. He, too, is nearing 40 and dives into fitness science to figure out whether he can perform at a higher level and avoid injuries while pursuing amateur soccer well into the coming decades.

What he finds is that for any athlete, recovery, rest, and the rhythm of workouts are as important as practicing drills and lifting weights. “We are conditioned to believe that working out equals feeling beat up,” Bercovici writes. But chronic overtraining is what dooms an athlete, he says, and increases the risk of injury and performance decline. While injuries are the unknown factor that athletes obsess over, whether they are avoided is not just a matter of luck or fitness, but a skill that can be learned.

![](1*Udr2xsPkNanNi3OAMYfaTA.jpeg)

He drives this home with a study of the injury rates of athletes training under different coaches. Coaches who are lighter on training during the season can expect fewer players to be benched by injuries. Genetic testing has revealed differences in DNA that regulate the thickness of ligaments and tendons, so sequencing athlete genomes can reveal who is more prone to sprains and tears. Another recommendation emerges: athletes should sleep as much as possible. Roger Federer and LeBron James aim for 12 hours a night.

Bercovici’s reporting is terrifically engaging and his breakdown of science is approachable. But he leaves out a huge realm of investigation in fitness.

He notes that a half-century ago, a 40-year-old who jogged for exercise or lifted weights at the gym was a novelty. He uses this to support the idea that a significant cultural change has brought acceptance for the older athlete, and therefore higher levels of achievement are now possible. “Peering into the world of elite athletes is literally a glimpse into the future the rest of us will soon be living in,” he predicts. He lays this futurist optimism on especially thick in one chapter about new technologies and wearables that athletes are using to make their workouts smarter. They’re stimulating motor regions of the brain, measuring biomarkers that predict their levels of fatigue, and benefiting from streamlined new materials for shoes and clothes.

![](1*rLYeNyi-2-WjpFULyAwCFg.png)

Yet as Christopher McDougall described in his 2009 book *Born to Run*, there are entire indigenous communities made up of people whose physical fitness matches that of elite athletes. They have no coaches, no Spandex, and no high-protein smoothies. But they do rest a lot, eat a lot of protein, and have a lot of low-level physical activity on a daily basis. Recent work conducted by University of Cincinnati anthropologist Jeremy Koster has revealed that hunter-gatherers’ physical decline is very gradual. A 55-year-old has 85 percent of the agility and hunting ability of a 31-year-old. Koster notes that experience might have a lot to do with it, which fits with some of Bercovici’s reporting on the superior mental game of older athletes.

Thus it may be more accurate to say that the world of elite athletes is a reminder of the past that we all used to live in, rather than a glimpse of our future. The science depicted in *Play On *is recent, but the R&D of evolution goes back millions of years. As I enter my fifth decade, I think it’s wiser to skip the hyperbaric pods and cryosaunas in favor of being active outdoors as much as possible.

# The Audacity of Synthetic Biologists

## Sophia Roosth puts big questions to the people who are reviving extinct species and building organisms from scratch.

![Illustration by Nick Vokey](1*tctfAMEKkT0UtSlOdOFKCg.png)*Illustration by Nick Vokey*

Molecular biology tells us that even the simplest cells are confoundingly complex and that to understand them, scientists must experiment on and observe cells. But the subfield of synthetic biology counters: *what if the best way to understand cells is to just build them from scratch?*

Science historian and anthropologist Sophia Roosth spent nearly a decade observing and interviewing self-declared synthetic biologists, a loosely defined cohort of engineers, scientists, and citizens who design and build artificial organisms.

Today synthetic biology undergirds applications in many fields, including pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and biofuels and other chemicals. Investors are pouring [more than $1 billion](http://synbiobeta.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/03/Synthetic-Biology-Industry-Annual-Growth-Update-2017.pdf) into synthetic biology companies each year. But Roosth began her fieldwork in an earlier phase, at MIT in the mid-2000s. That led her into conversations with biohackers, electrical-engineers-turned-microbe-designers, leaders of pharma startups, scientific “copyleft” advocates, and distinguished biologists who hope to “resurrect” extinct species through 21st century biotechnology. Though their goals and methods are diverse, Roosth noticed several common threads—especially that synthetic biologists try to “know” the biological world by designing and constructing new lifeforms.

Genomes that have evolved in nature over millions of years are full of overlapping sequences, incomplete remnants of old genes, and long stretches of DNA with no discernable purpose. Synthetic biologists eschew that messiness; their organisms are made to fit the synthetic biologist’s purposes and aesthetics. In most synbio operations, any artificial organisms that don’t fit the mold are discarded. For Roosth, that raised a question: What ideas, assumptions, and goals do synthetic biologists bring to this work?

Roosth, a professor at Harvard, distilled her observations into an anthology-like [book](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo25468780.html) called *Synthetic: How Life Got Made*, and I called her to find out more. Here are a few of the highlights, edited for length and clarity.

![](1*AaOTWEMhFmRaEISnS0QldA.png)

**Going back to the beginning, why write an ethnography of synthetic biologists?**

I was curious about a few things. One was: How is bioengineering being harnessed both for design projects and as a kind of pedagogical tool? And I was interested in this democratization of engineering. What does it mean to have undergraduate students designing organisms?

The people were coming from electrical engineering, computer science, among other fields. What I noticed was that moving from a home discipline like electrical engineering into synthetic biology, people were also importing certain metaphors and ways of thinking.

**Can you give an example?**

When Drew Endy [now a Stanford professor] was a grad student, he sought to build a computational model that would predict the behavior of the bacteriophage T7. Now, the phage is a really simple, well-characterized entity. It’s been studied in labs for 60 years, and it doesn’t do that much.

But the computational model was a very poor predictor of T7’s behavior. And while it might seem common sense to some people that that meant there was something wrong with the model, he instead inferred that there was something wrong *with the virus.*

That [raised] a series of questions both for him and for his colleagues about what it would mean for a biological entity to be well-designed. And what it meant for it to be well designed, [Endy decided], was for it to be comprehensible, that is understandable to humans. Which is a radically different definition of what counts as good design.

**You say in your book that synthetic biologists are complicating our definitions of lineage and related-ness. How so?**

The question that arises when you look at an engineered microbe — say, a bacteria that contains lots of different genes from very diverse species is: how do you then place that on any kind of taxonomic tree or lineage?

Some people would actually cite the way that model has broken down in recent years because of the increasing research about lateral gene transfer [which is when microbes swap genes among themselves]. Bioengineering is considered by some synthetic biologists to be a difference of degree but not of kind from what nature does on its own, which is mix lots of different genes together.

![](1*2HRkyyrC-d-P5NZzsZHisg.png)

**In the final chapter, you discuss the “de-extinction movement,” which proposes to resurrect extinct species through bioengineering. How does the de-extinction movement connect to the rest of synthetic biology, and how is it different?**

I think the de-extinction movement is the most extreme, media-genic version of synthetic biology.

Efforts to “resurrect” extinct species involve cobbling together lots of different genetic material. For example, the woolly mammoth project includes several key genes that were sequenced from woolly mammoth tissue, but those would be ported into an elephant genome. So then the question is: when is something really a woolly mammoth and when is it just sort of a fancy elephant with tusks and really thick hair?

When I asked de-extinction biologists this question … the answer was, “Well, if it looks enough like that extinct species, then it is that [species].”

Which brings us back to the bacteriophage: when is it a successful design project? Well, if it’s able to infect bacteria, then that’s a good phage. If it’s easier to understand, then it’s a good phage. Perhaps you could say something similar about passenger pigeons and woolly mammoths.

**Late in the book, you make a point about synthetic biology becoming more “normal,” at least in terms of how the public perceives it. What does that trend mean to you?**

A nice earlier example of this is recombinant DNA research. Recombinant DNA was considered to be a huge deal in the 1970s with regard to ethics and the ontology of what was being made, and now it’s something that’s done in most biology labs without even thinking twice about it.
 
That’s why I thought it was important to write this book now, because it’s much more interesting to track these formations, biological and cultural formations, when they’re still remarkable and while they’re still up for debate. Because once they cease to be remarkable, we cease to ask important questions about them.

# The Elusive Definition of Wellness

## If you ask people around the world how healthy they think they are, you’ll get some surprising answers.

B y many objective measures, people in Japan tend to be healthy. The country’s cancer rates are relatively low, and its life expectancy is among the [longest in the world](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html) — about 87 years for women and 81 for men. And yet people in Japan are far less likely than people in other prosperous countries to say they’re in good health, according to survey [data collated](http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_STAT) by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Another striking contrast comes at the other end of the list. Obesity and other factors correlated with poor health are relatively high in the United States, which is why life expectancy for Americans is[ increasing to a lesser extent](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)32381-9/fulltext) than in, say, South Korea. But the vast majority of people in the U.S. say they’re healthy. Maybe Americans are kidding themselves, while Japanese and Koreans are more reluctant to take good health for granted. Whatever the reasons for the disparity, it’s a reminder that the quest for wellness means very different things to different people.

# The Genius of Our Lizard Brain

## Emotions don’t get in the way of rational thought, says Antonio Damasio. They make it possible.

![Illustration by Nick Vokey](1*r8L_BHiWRjHEjrlhLPaiOA.jpeg)*Illustration by Nick Vokey*

The age-old distinction between the heart and the head is completely wrong. That’s one of the central ideas in [*The Strange Order of Things](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Order-Things-Feeling-Cultures-ebook/dp/B01LZ1A3Q3?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=neodotlife-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=e7ff34a7bb96aab3f01cb123b4f258a4&camp=1789&creative=9325)*, a new book by Antonio Damasio, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Southern California.

Emotions and feelings are often regarded as evolutionary relics handed down to us from an ancestral “reptilian brain”—mere physiological responses that cloud our ability to think rationally. According to Damasio, however, we underestimate the importance of feelings in our lives—and for civilization itself.

Damasio is a leading researcher on the nature of consciousness and first proposed a version of this idea, the “somatic marker” hypothesis, in 1994. He argued that the brain and the body work together to generate consciousness of the self within one’s surroundings. Far from being vestigial responses, feelings influence higher-order thought processes such as decision-making. But in *The Strange Order of Things*, Damasio takes it much further, suggesting that feelings and emotions were the main driving forces behind human achievement.

Damasio makes this argument by expanding on the biological concept of homeostasis. Conventionally, homeostasis is taken to mean a set of regulatory mechanisms by which cells keep their functions and metabolite concentrations within a certain range, to maintain an internal environment conducive for life to flourish. But Damasio thinks that definition is too narrow. He argues that homeostasis is also at play beyond the cellular scale and includes the regulation of feelings and emotions.

Organisms strive for pleasant feelings and emotions that promote well-being, rather than unpleasant ones, which can be detrimental to health. In other words, homeostatic mechanisms not only maintain order within single cells but also play the critical role of “life regulation,” tipping the balance toward positive feelings and emotions. And emotions, combined with creative intelligence, led to what we call culture: art, music, and poetry were developed because of their positive affect, and medicine emerged out of the need to alleviate pain and suffering.

Damasio extrapolates this yet further, to suggest that these homeostatic life-regulation mechanisms govern not just the behavior of individuals but also that of larger groups of people, as well as political and economic systems, which could be viewed as devices that were invented to help humanity flourish as a whole. This constant striving for positive emotions and well-being is a double-edged sword: it led to science and technology, which continue to improve the human condition, but also to failed governments, and weapons of mass destruction, causing much suffering.
> # Refreshingly, Damasio attributes feelings and consciousness to a wide variety of other animals.

If that doesn’t seem ambitious enough, the picture Damasio paints is much bigger still. Taking the origins of life itself as his starting point, he charts the emergence of sensing and feeling. Bacteria are adept at sensing and responding to chemical cues and they, too, show “a determined desire to endure” and flourish, but only organisms with complex nervous systems that can form and manipulate mental images are capable of “feeling.” The subjectivity that comes with such feelings is a key component of consciousness.

The idea that things happening in the body can impact brain function is now gaining wide acceptance. Damasio’s somatic marker hypothesis — itself based partly on the ideas of the pioneering William James a century earlier — pre-empted the modern scientific study of interoception, our sense of what is happening in the body. New research [is beginning to reveal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594730/) just how physiological signals such as the heartbeat can influence brain function.

The claim that emotional regulation plays a role in economics is not as new. There is an old saying on Wall Street that the market is driven by greed and fear, and Adam Smith argued over 200 years ago that individuals acting out of self-interest make society as a whole better off, because of the “invisible hand” of market forces. Nonetheless, Damasio’s main thesis — that homeostatic “life regulation” mechanisms led to cultural innovations and organizational behavior — challenges economic models that rely on Smith’s “invisible hand” mechanism, and will surely fuel some debate.

Using homeostasis to explain everything from armed conflict to financial crises seems over-ambitious. Nonetheless, this is a thought-provoking book that provides a novel perspective on consciousness and social behavior. Unlike many others, it acknowledges the role of the body and, refreshingly, attributes feelings and consciousness to a wide variety of other animals.

At the end of a journey that takes us from single cells to brains and minds capable of conscious awareness, Damasio acknowledges how little we still know. But the final destination is not as important as his interesting speculative detours. For example, there are similarities between the primitive nerve nets found in brainless animals like jellyfish and the clusters of neurons in the enteric nervous system in our digestive tract. This part of our gut — which is crucial for interoception — could be thought of as the first brain, just as meaningful as the one in our heads.

# Reset Your DNA to Slow the Clock

## Reset Your DNA to Slow the Clock

### A new epigenetic test that tracks molecular aging claims to show you how to stay biologically young.

For less than a hundred bucks, many companies will take your tube of spit and decode the DNA within. That string of letters holds clues to where you came from and which diseases you and your children could face. By and large, our genetic code doesn’t change.

But DNA *expression* — how genes get turned on and off — changes all the time. And with aging and other circumstances, life’s blueprint accrues long-lasting chemical alterations that control how and when certain genes or groups of genes turn on.


Unlike the underlying genetic code, which is fixed, these epigenetic modifications are dynamic. Shifting in response to factors including where you live, what you eat, and how much you exercise and sleep, your epigenetic code influences which genes are easily activated and which never or rarely get turned on. These genome-wide patterns could be an index of health at the molecular level. And you can now see what this code says, thanks to companies using technology that “turns DNA testing into this actionable measure of deep health that you can do something about,” says Toby Call, cofounder of a biotech startup called Chronomics in Cambridge, England.

In February the company started selling a saliva test that measures an epigenetic marker called DNA methylation, which can shift with environment and lifestyle. Customers who get the $699-a-year basic plan can log onto a web portal to find out their “biological age” — a [well-established metric](https://www.nature.com/news/biomarkers-and-ageing-the-clock-watcher-1.15014) built on research by Steve Horvath, a University of California Los Angeles geneticist and biostatistician.
> # Obesity may make the epigenetic clock in human liver cells tick faster, and heroin use can accelerate biological aging in brain cells.

Whereas chronological age simply reflects how many years you’ve lived, biological age can vary between two people born in the same year, or even between identical twins. It depends on how you’ve lived and what you’ve encountered. For instance, obesity may make the epigenetic clock in human liver cells tick faster, and heroin use can accelerate biological aging in brain cells. Simply put, biological age reflects how old you *seem*.

Chronomics’ DNA analysis might show, for example, that you’re biologically two years older than your actual age. Navigating your online account, you could compare your aging pattern with others in your city or age group. Each week you can log what you eat and how much time you sleep, work up a sweat, or do a mindfulness practice such as meditation. Clicking a bright orange bar shows how you might “turn back time” through recommendations to reduce your methylation age by eating fewer processed foods or by adopting stress-reducing activities like yoga.

For an additional $300 per year, Chronomics’ customers can receive scores for two additional indicators: smoke exposure (how many cigarettes it looks like your body has smoked, including from secondhand sources) and body composition (a color-graded map with risk scores for insulin resistance, heart disease and other obesity-related conditions). All are calculated by next-generation sequencing technology that uses big data and machine learning to hone the predictive power of methylation markers at 5 million sites in the genome, says Call.

![](1*iu0xPFXj5GcWiyEcSA5lbw.png)

He was completing his PhD in biochemistry at the University of Cambridge when cofounders Tom Stubbs and Daniel Martín Herranz started discussing how the DNA analysis technology they were using in their doctoral projects in computational epigenetics might be used “to do something good in the world,” Call says. The company is now funded by the global venture capital firm SOSV, which runs the RebelBio and [IndieBio](https://medium.com/neodotlife/arvind-gupta-indie-bio-7a5557c41b70) life science accelerator programs, and by a seed round of funding from a London VC that Call would not reveal.

“Our message is choice and change,” he says. So far, many of the company’s hundred or so first customers are people who were interested in health optimization but hadn’t yet chosen a DNA test. At the [Biohacker Summit](https://new.biohackersummit.com/) in Toronto last week, Call says, the company drew interest from health tech enthusiasts as well as folks “off the street” — many of them engineers, doctors, and businesspeople who are “interested in removing the guesswork with their health.”

### **Where’s the action?**

The idea that knowing your own DNA methylation status could help you make positive changes seems logical, but lacks scientific support. The promise that “epigenetic marks in apparently healthy people can tell them meaningful things about their health status is an overreach,” says Robert Green, a geneticist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who studies how consumer DNA tests influence health behavior.

Using DNA methylation to estimate biological age is great as a research tool, and lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking or losing weight can change methylation patterns. But there’s no proof that having that kind of information helps people have better health, agrees Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego. Such claims “are not substantiated,” he says. “It doesn’t mean they’re not true. There’s just no data to support it.”
> # The promise that “epigenetic marks in apparently healthy people can tell them meaningful things about their health status is an overreach,” says Robert Green.

Nevertheless, Call says that some doctors and health coaches are excited by the potential of epigenetics to catalyze positive change that enables people to “stay ahead of the disease curve.” Working with clients who are blind to the health implications of their life habits, he says, health professionals “want a telescope to provide people with the unavoidable facts and implications of their environmental and lifestyle factors today — something that until now was impossible.”

By comparison, Chronomics competitor Epimorphy offers no advice or health recommendations with myDNAge, its direct-to-consumer epigenetics test. “We offer [myDNAge] as a tool for people to know if it works for themselves,” says Yap Ching Chew, director of epigenetics technologies at Zymo Research, which developed the platform used by Epimorphy and shares a founder. Their test, which was introduced in July 2017 at $299, uses next-gen sequencing and measures DNA methylation at 500 sites to compute a person’s biological age from a blood or urine sample. Thousands of people have used the myDNAge test, Chew says.

As the company collects and analyzes more data, it hopes to offer more personalized insights in the future. At this point, she says, many myDNAge clients use the test once or twice a year in the hopes of gauging how well their anti-aging supplements are working.

Compared to the genetic code, epigenetic information seems more changeable in a biological sense but less actionable in a medical sense, Green says.

With genomic data, there are clear links between information received and recommended medical action. For example, says Green, research suggests that certain gene variants increase your sensitivity to specific drugs or increase your risk of certain cancers, so if you learned that you have those DNA variants, you could improve your health by controlling the dosage of that drug or more carefully monitoring for cancer. However, he adds, with epigenetics data very few studies have tested whether health-related advice has any impact on people’s behavior: “We are in the early days of using DNA variance to predict health and motivate behavior change.”

Even though the evidence is still preliminary, says Green, it’s clear that some people are activated by learning about their own DNA, and then they start eating better, exercising, and making other changes well known to improve health: “Learning about health through the prism of your own body … may motivate people more than learning about it from a public service announcement or from a doctor who says, ‘You know, you should lose a few pounds.’ ”

## The Future of Genetic Engineering

### A bioengineer, a biopunk, and a biotech reporter square off onstage about our neobiological future.

By [Jane Metcalfe](https://neo.life/author/jane-metcalfe/)

In a new documentary that is still in production, filmmaker Cody Sheehy follows renowned bioengineer George Church and biotech reporter Antonio Regalado to China for the 2nd International Summit on Human Genome Editing. That’s where biophysicist He Jiankui made the stunning announcement that he had edited the DNA of two twin girls who were born in October 2018. Back in California, the filmmaker catches up with biohacker Josiah Zayner, whose attention-grabbing exploits-part protest, part performance art-include injecting himself with a CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid.

What follows is a panel discussion I moderated among these three men, all of whom are shaping the story of the Neobiological Revolution. Presented by the [Hello Tomorrow Global Summit](https://hello-tomorrow.org/summit) in Paris in March 2019, the panel featured a trailer and early clips from the documentary, [*Code of the Wild](https://codeofthewild.org/)*. No release date has been set.

# “We Are All Janet”

## And with those closing words, our tears gradually dried, and the rabbi led the pallbearers and Janet Sollod’s casket out of the synagogue, accompanied by the appropriately mournful notes of the 23rd Psalm.

![Photo courtesy of Rusty Sammon](1*BPTmPbL_CrpEpCF-tHUBVQ.jpeg)*Photo courtesy of Rusty Sammon*

Janet was a miracle. Still alive nine years after her breast cancer diagnosis at the age of 32, and seven years after discovering that it had metastasized to her liver, she was going to keep on living, and learn to die, on her own terms.

So she kept seeing her pediatric patients, volunteering her time to sick children in her off hours, dancing, planning trips with friends to wherever the snow was deep and good for boarding, and to Burning Man, sometimes in a rainbow suit, sometimes wearing unicorn pajamas. Usually with purple hair.

Janet was a [leader](https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/02/breast-cancer-metastatic-group/), an instigator, someone others turned to instinctively. She had enormous empathy and a great faith in the universe, despite knowing she would die young. She was always exploring, always learning, always participating in and shaping her various communities. She isn’t gone, because her spirit and her example remain inside everyone who knew her. And now we are all Janet.

She looked death straight in the face, and asked us to do the same. Her courage and wisdom were formidable.

I first met and most often saw Janet at the (highly recommended) Exponential Medicine conference, where the future of health and medicine is presented by scientific, medical, and entrepreneurial leaders. The sheer abundance of promising research and entrepreneurial effort leads us to believe that solutions are at hand, and in fact, science and great doctors allowed Janet to survive years longer than expected, so she could climb more mountains and slide down the other side. We can prevent genetic disease, end age-related diseases, and extend life well beyond our 80s. Some imagine senescence as a cellular “malfunction” we can avoid, thereby leading us to immortality, or at least very, very long lives. We have theoretical solutions and some pretty God-like technologies, like CRISPR, to explore and develop.

But in the meantime, people like Janet teach us first and foremost to live a good life, and secondly, to plan a good death. See her inspiring talk at last year’s Exponential Medicine here:

# What My Smart Shoes Taught Me

## How you track your steps matters way less than who you do it with.

![Illustration by Yann Le Bec](1*z38WJQMY1KJf1CAgCgJ8Hg.jpeg)*Illustration by Yann Le Bec*

The majority of wearable fitness devices on the market are wristbands or watches. Yet that’s not the most logical place for monitoring the steps you take, the distance you cover, and other workout metrics. The real action is happening on the ground.

That’s why changing the locus of tracking from the wrist to the feet might seem like a good way to remove the friction that keeps people from adopting trackers for the long term.


There are over a dozen options: smart socks, insoles, clip-on trackers, foot pods for the laces or tops of shoes, trackers embedded into the sole, and even GPS-enabled shoelaces. The makers of such devices say they can improve not just how fast and how far you run, but also how well you run. They do this by tracking your foot landing patterns, the cadence of your steps, and how much time your feet spend on the ground or in stride. Trackers on the feet should be more accurate than, say, a Fitbit, which doesn’t usually differentiate your movements very well, given that it rings up steps when you run up the stairs and when you gesticulate while talking on the phone. By tracking from your feet, there’s no false sense of accomplishment about how many “steps” you took.

As a committed long-distance runner and aspiring minimalist, I wanted to try what I figured would be the least fussy and most effective of these options: the $100 HOVR Sonic Connected running shoes by Under Armour. I found that measuring workout data from the feet indeed has advantages — but also that better tracking technology isn’t the answer to helping more people live healthier lives.

### Trial runs

Under Armour was one of the first companies to come out with a connected shoe, and its second iteration is the HOVR Sonic. It lets you lace up for a run and leave the phone and wristband behind. Sensors embedded in the midsole track a wide array of metrics — including distance, duration, stride length, average pace, and cadence — which will show up on Under Armour’s MapMyRun app once you return home and sync up with your phone. (If you do want to run with your phone, the shoe can send you updates on your pace via the headphones, and the app has a few audio workouts to urge you along.)
> # “A lot of wearables will get cast aside because unfortunately, they don’t possess the magic ability to change human behaviors long-term.”

You can treat these shoes like a normal pair — there’s nothing to plug in. Its batteries are supposedly designed to outlast the life of the shoe, and the built-in analytics will alert you when the mileage is getting high and it’s time to buy a new set. However, your personal standards for shoe condition may vary from the manufacturer’s. I am skeptical that we need to be purchasing new kicks every few months. So the claim that the battery never runs out might not apply for everyone.

Despite chic marketing images of sexy, sweaty athletes pounding down grimy alleyways, these shoes aren’t really as freeing as they’re made out to be. The metrics that the HOVR Sonic tracks — and the recommendations on the app — are most meaningful if you run in an urban setting with flat, continuous surfaces; you run steadily without pause; and you like shoes with thick soles that require a heel-striking gait. If you run on uneven terrain in natural settings like I do (and get frequently sidetracked by flora and fauna), it’s basically worthless to collect information about your cadence and pace.

![**Sensors in the midsole of the HOVR Sonic Connected register distance, duration, stride length, average pace, and cadence.** (Photo courtesy of Under Armour)](1*toXNnxx7qbwxXerV9v4KhA.jpeg)***Sensors in the midsole of the HOVR Sonic Connected register distance, duration, stride length, average pace, and cadence.** (Photo courtesy of Under Armour)*

Naturally it follows that the HOVR Sonic Connected shoes perform better than wrist-based trackers for treadmill runs. Fitbits and the like require back-and-forth arm motion to recognize that you’re moving, but these shoes will know you’re running even if your hands are resting on the treadmill handles. (A hack for Fitbits is to strap it to your ankle, but that’s cumbersome.)

So the shoe might help seasoned runners get a bit more information about their workouts. That’s all fine and good. But there seems to be a bigger promise that all wearable technology should be addressing: Can these shoes help people develop healthier habits?

### People power

Ted Robertson, a managing director with the applied behavioral science nonprofit ideas42, watched me scamper off for my first runs with HOVR Sonic shoes and questioned their value. “A lot of wearables will get cast aside because unfortunately, they don’t possess the magic ability to change human behaviors long-term,” he said. “They have a limited impact for most of us, and seem to work best for people who are already intrinsically motivated to be more active or adopt healthy habits.”

Given that I’ve already been a committed runner since age 12, he’s saying that these shoes are just a novelty for me. The truth is that I’ll run whether or not I track my steps. It just happens to be fun for me to know exactly what I ran. But what about the pre-diabetic senior who doesn’t have an exercise habit and desperately wants to get in better shape? Or the millions of people who have been told by their doctors to lose weight? Multiple studies predict that just playing around with certain shoes or a Fitbit isn’t going to help them get healthier. But if they joined a team or club, tracked their progress with other people, and made a game out of it, their chances of avoiding a chronic diagnosis go up.
> # I’d love for my shoes to tell me if I am in the top 10 percent of runners in my neighborhood and send me an invite for a post-run breakfast with all of them.

We know that the biggest determinants of health outcomes are [not physiological, they’re social](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-02-social-isolation-health-message.html). Mortality rates are much higher among the socially isolated, regardless of lifestyle choices. In a [recent experiment](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.3458), study participants committed to various goals for steps in a day. Some of them did it essentially on their own, while others were in a game, in which their step counts were compared to those of teammates. The people who played the game were more active and improved more on health measures than the people who used trackers alone.

The future of wearables is in building community, which is better for customers and ultimately better for profits. I could imagine new social groups forming through gyms and fitness organizations that sponsor wearable-tech assisted competitions and ongoing challenges. I’d love for my shoes to tell me if I am in the top 10 percent of runners in my neighborhood by distance and send me an invite for a post-run breakfast with all of them.

The next generation of wearables should capitalize more on this fundamental insight about human nature and activity: We’re better together, no matter where on our bodies we’re wearing our tracking tech.

# Who Says You Need Permission to Study Yourself?

## Sara Riggare can’t finish her PhD because an ethics committee says she needed their approval first.

![**The authorities say scientist Sara Riggare should have obtained ethical approval for her work — even though she is her own research subject.** Illustration by Calum Heath](1*Slu7WreKdPDevl9soxquOA.gif)***The authorities say scientist Sara Riggare should have obtained ethical approval for her work — even though she is her own research subject.** Illustration by Calum Heath*

For the past six years, Sara Riggare, who has Parkinson’s disease, has been conducting research on herself as part of her PhD at the prestigious Karolinska Institute in Sweden. Using mobile apps, she tracks her symptoms, sleep, and activity.

She’s not unique in doing so: Many people self-monitor with apps and wearable devices like Fitbit and the Apple Watch, a trend spurred by the broader Quantified Self movement, where “lifeloggers” track everything from their blood sugar to their microbiome, and even carry out experiments on themselves.


But Riggare goes further than most in using her self-experimentation to contribute to science — including publishing studies on herself. In one [study](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-parkinsons-disease/jpd181314) in the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease, she describes using a smartphone app that measures finger-tapping speed to evaluate how the effects of her Parkinson’s medications vary over the course of the day. For another peer-reviewed study, she vaped with an e-cigarette, then tracked and analyzed the effects of nicotine on her Parkinson’s symptoms. She gleaned important health insights from both studies, including that nicotine seemed to decrease the involuntary movements that are a common side effect of one drug.

But earlier this month, Riggare was told by a dissertation committee that she wouldn’t be able to defend her PhD in November as planned. The reason? She didn’t get approval from an ethics committee prior to conducting these studies. No law explicitly prevents her from experimenting on herself as a private person, but her dissertation committee interpreted a Swedish law called the Ethical Review Act to mean that she should’ve first obtained that permission because her experiments are considered research.

“The Swedish law on ethical review states that research on human beings with the intention to affect a research person physically may only be conducted after acquiring ethical permit,” the Karolinska Institute said in a statement provided to NEO.LIFE. “The reason is that research subjects must be protected. As a PhD student, Sara Riggare is part of a research group that includes her supervisors. The research group may not perform experiments on human beings without ethical permit, even if the person is one of its members.”
> # Should anyone have the power to prevent people from experimenting on themselves — or be able to deny credit for the science that self-experimenters produce?

In other words, the dissertation committee considered the two studies she had done toward her degree inadmissible. The Karolinska Institute requires that doctoral students publish at least two papers in peer-reviewed journals before they can defend their thesis. If Riggare can’t get retroactive approval for her research, she’ll have to do more research, which could take years.

Riggare was disappointed. (She announced the ruling on public Facebook and blog posts, but declined to make herself available for an interview, citing her health and workload.)

In an era of empowered patients and DIY scientists who constantly collect data about themselves on apps and smart devices, patient-driven research raises important questions. Should anyone have the power to prevent people from experimenting on themselves — or be able to deny credit for the science that self-experimenters produce?

“Of course we as a society need to ensure that all medical research is conducted in an ethical manner,” Riggare wrote in her [post](http://www.riggare.se/2018/09/16/ethics-and-phd/). “We also have a collective responsibility to ensure that our rules and regulations are appropriate for the day and age we live in.”

### Who experiments on who?

Medical research actually has a long history of self-experimentation. And in many cases, it’s been heralded. Werner Forssmann, who performed the first heart catheterization on himself, and Barry Marshall, who gave himself ulcers in order to prove they were caused by bacterial infection, both won Nobel Prizes for their extreme experiments.

![**At the world-renowned Karolinska Institute, Nobel Prize winners give their talks at the Aula Medica lecture hall. **Image by Ainali/Wikipedia](1*0d4u0oYQjjlgu4OEjWNzgg.jpeg)***At the world-renowned Karolinska Institute, Nobel Prize winners give their talks at the Aula Medica lecture hall. **Image by Ainali/Wikipedia*

Since the 1970s, though, the research world has moved to a system in which studies involving human subjects need to be first reviewed and approved by an ethics committee. This [requirement](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html) was designed to prevent abuses committed under the guise of medical research, like the Tuskegee experiment, in which African American men with syphilis were deliberately left untreated.

In the U.S., an institutional review board or IRB has the authority to approve or veto a study, or ask for modifications; other countries have their own versions. Their purpose is to protect human participants. One way they do that is by making sure researchers provide volunteers with clear information about any risks in the study, and get the participants’ informed consent — that is to say, the participants fully understand what they’re getting into and agree to it anyway.

“The whole reason that ethics boards exist is because of the information asymmetry in research,” says Mad Price Ball, executive director of the Open Humans Project, a platform that allows you to upload, connect and store your health data. That asymmetry means that volunteers typically know much less about the risks than the researchers do.

Self-experimentation, however, changes the formula. In this case the researcher who knows the most about the study is also the study’s volunteer.

“When the researcher and the participant are one and the same, the idea that they are not adequately informed but that some ethical committee is, I think is silly,” says Michelle Meyer, a bioethicist and lawyer at Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania.

Under some circumstances, she notes, self-experimentation can raise ethical concerns. For example, graduate students could possibly feel pressure to do research on themselves to get published or do a dissertation.

“You could imagine the principal investigator of a lab saying, ‘We’re all going to test this on ourselves,’” she says. “Just because they’re all co-investigators on a study doesn’t mean that there can’t be power differentials that could be troubling.”
> # There’s a real concern that the science produced by people like Riggare will be lost, says Mad Price Ball.

Christian Munthe, professor of practical philosophy at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and a member of the delegation for medical ethics of the Swedish Society of Medicine says he agrees with the Karolinska Institute’s review of Swedish law. However, he says, “the legal fault formally falls on the head of department for the unit where the candidate’s research was undertaken. It is, furthermore, good reason for the candidate to demand and get compensation in the form of extended PhD funding for the lost time, so that she can finish her PhD training in a proper manner.”

In the U.S., Meyer says, many IRBs have taken a similar position: if you’re doing research and it involves human subjects, you are a human subject even if you’re also the researcher.

“I think the conversation is about whether that’s an appropriate policy or not,” says Meyer, adding that IRBs weren’t designed with self-experimentation in mind.

Ball expects that other scientific self-experimenters, including in the U.S., could also be denied credit for their work, and worries it could encourage “senseless risk aversion” in research. Plus, Ball says, there’s a real concern that the science produced by people like Riggare will be lost: “When knowledge has been gained, should you really decide to toss a whole body of work into the dumpster? That’s a serious ethical question.”

# That Kombucha Looks Fabulous on You

## Hipster tea sludge is being transformed into a wonder material.

![**Sacha Laurin has made kombucha clothing with attention-getting designs, but the material and similar bacterial byproducts also have practical possibilities. **(Courtesy of Sacha Laurin)](1*gP0nyjuAbhGTEYWr-Eabjw.jpeg)***Sacha Laurin has made kombucha clothing with attention-getting designs, but the material and similar bacterial byproducts also have practical possibilities. **(Courtesy of Sacha Laurin)*

When I unseal the envelope and put my nose under the flap for a recklessly deep sniff, the smell hits me like a punch to the gullet. I recognize it from a long-ago, and nauseating, visit to a penicillin factory. It’s the smell of microbes doing their private work, magnified to human scale. But the crisp sheets that have come in the mail from California aren’t medicine. They’re the dried residue of kombucha tea.

Kombucha is a trendy fermented drink. To brew it, you start with sugared tea and add a rubbery mat called a scoby, kind of like a sourdough starter. Scoby stands for “symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast” and looks like a huge wad of snot. Some of the bacteria in this floating ecosystem naturally manufacture cellulose, the fiber that makes up paper and cotton. If you [dry out a scoby](http://www.instructables.com/id/Kombucha-Fabric/), you get a tough, versatile, and Earth-friendly material that has the potential to shake up fashion and other industries.


My envelope of “kombucha leather,” or bacterial cellulose, came from UC Davis design professor Christina Cogdell. She’s co-teaching a class with biomedical engineering professor Marc Facciotti in which student teams are experimenting with applications for kombucha leather. At the end of the school year, they’ll send a team to the [Biodesign Challenge](http://biodesignchallenge.org/).

Over a video chat, Cogdell shows me stacks of tubs growing scoby in her office. It’s also possible to isolate cellulose-making bacteria and use them to grow the material on their own, without the other members of a scoby community; some of Cogdell and Facciotti’s students will use the isolated strain *Komagataeibacter xylinus*. No one knows exactly why certain bacteria make cellulose. It might be to keep the microbes floating near the surface of their environment where there’s more oxygen, or to protect them from ultraviolet light. Whatever its purpose, bacterial cellulose is purer than cellulose made by plants, which can contain other molecules like lignin and pectin. Left on their own to dry, Cogdell’s microbial mats will turn into stiff sheets, not unlike an untreated animal hide.
> # Imagine clothing with a repair patch that you could keep alive in the fridge, then stick onto a damaged item.

Cogdell learned how to grow bacterial cellulose from Sacha Laurin, a former cheesemaker who runs a business called [Kombucha Couture](http://www.kombuchacouture.com/) in Davis, California. Laurin has exhibited her fashion designs at shows in Paris and elsewhere. They include dresses, skirts, and bikini tops; the material has a semi-translucent quality that gives the clothing an alien-meets-caveperson vibe.

“I love that it is pure cellulose, a building block of life itself, that is spun by microbes,” Laurin says. She adds that people feel “magical and like a god or goddess” when they wear her clothes. Laurin also likes that the material is a kind of sustainable leather substitute — it’s totally biodegradable and animal-free. Wet layers will seal themselves together seamlessly. She imagines one day selling clothing with a repair patch that you could keep alive in the fridge, then stick onto a damaged item.

Students in the UC Davis class are experimenting with many aspects of bacterial cellulose. One is rubbing the material with different substances as it dries to soften it. Other students are working on making clothing, grocery bags, water pitcher filters, diapers, and tampons. In labs elsewhere, scientists are turning bacterial cellulose into paper and artificial skin. An American company already sells bacterial cellulose for wound dressing.

The cellulose fibers made by bacteria are thinner and stronger than cellulose fibers from plants, and extremely absorbent. That’s why the material has potential for feminine hygiene products. Unfortunately, that’s also why you can’t wear kombucha leather out in the rain. At the end of her 2011 [TED talk](https://youtu.be/3p3-vl9VFYU), kombucha leather pioneer Suzanne Lee remarked that the vest she had on was absorbing her sweat and disintegrating in front of the audience’s eyes.

![**A scoby. **(Courtesy of Lukas Chin/Wikipedia)](1*89Y8Tff1qTZDgFiVGmfPvg.jpeg)***A scoby. **(Courtesy of Lukas Chin/Wikipedia)*

Even if you keep your kombucha clothing dry, its lifespan might be only six months. “It just wants to break down like a fresh leaf becomes old and brittle,” Laurin says. She suggests that people who buy her custom pieces clean them with baby wipes. But she thinks a more durable, machine-washable version would appeal to a wider audience. Scaling up the production is also a challenge to making kombucha leather more mainstream. Cogdell says it takes two to three weeks to grow a thick piece in one of her tubs.

There’s already an industry producing bacterial cellulose at large scales — although not for clothing. In the Phillipines, coconut water is fermented with cellulose-making bacteria to make a chewy jelly dessert called *nata de coco. *But Tom Ellis, a synthetic biologist at Imperial College London, thinks the textile version needs some tweaks before it will be mass produced. “In its current form it doesn’t offer anything substantially better or different” than traditional textiles like cotton or leather, Ellis says.

That’s why he’s researching ways to genetically and chemically engineer the material. To demonstrate how tweaking the microbes’ genes can change the fabric, he and colleagues recently [engineered bacteria](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/24/E3431) to make their cellulose with a green fluorescent protein. The resulting fabric is pale chartreuse in regular light, and glows under blue light. Besides building in dyes, scientists could add anti-microbial molecules to bacterial cellulose for bandages, or engineer it to better conduct electricity. **“**If we can produce a version of bacterial cellulose with exciting new properties never seen with leather, cotton or synthetic fibers, then it holds real promise beyond just being an interesting fad,” Ellis says.

As for the smell, some people don’t mind it. At UC Davis, Facciotti says, “the lab now has a new fragrance.” He and Cogdell have found that treating the material with sodium hydroxide helps. Laurin rubs her kombucha leather with proprietary oil blends. But she says more and more people tell her they actually love the smell. Maybe, like real leather, it will become more pleasant with familiarity.

# When Diet and Lifestyle Aren’t Enough

## Supplements and the people who take them.

Americans spend almost as much money on vitamins and other dietary supplements — $41 billion, according to *Nutrition Business Journal* — [as on organic food](https://www.ota.com/news/press-releases/19031). What are these pills and powders doing for us? We’re still finding out.

A lot of published research indicates that multivitamins and individual supplements don’t offer [much benefit](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2565733). But what exactly it is that people are taking is changing all the time. [A recent study](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2565748) of trends in supplement usage found that people have been popping less of vitamins C and E and selenium than they did in the 1990s and more vitamin D (and now we might be [overdoing D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311368/)). And vitamin D isn’t even growing nearly as fast as probiotics, whose sales were expected to jump 17 percent in 2016, according to *Nutrition Business Journal* says.

All the while, the overall supplement business has been growing more than 5 percent a year. Watch this market closely — more and more people who want to be healthier are simply not going to stop experimenting.

# I Study the Female Brain. Here’s What “The Female Brain” Gets Wrong.

## Researching orgasms gives this reviewer some perspective on the new comedy by Whitney Cummings.

![**Whitney Cummings** **as Julia.** (Courtesy of IFC Films)](1*EtL8iEv7v2MwOEI7WIfMhQ.jpeg)***Whitney Cummings** **as Julia.** (Courtesy of IFC Films)*

Asking a neuroscientist to watch *The Female Brain* without the benefit of anxiolytics was chasing trouble. But on Valentine’s Day I took myself on a date with an open mind. Any flick claiming to portray gender differences in the brain would have to exaggerate their size. If they wanted to make a woman have a pratfall because she has .02 percent poorer depth perception than men generally do, I would schadenfreude right along.

What I did not expect was Julia. Julia has my job: an emotion neuroscientist. Coming off of *Grey’s Anatomy, *whose sex neuroscientist was an oversexed lesbian spouting false facts about orgasm “lighting up the whole brain,” I was pessimistic. Would *The Female Brain*, a romantic-comedy adaptation of a 2006 book by psychiatrist Louann Brizendine,* *get us right?


The film bounces between the stories of four couples, with cutaways to PowerPoints of neuroscience-y explanations of each of their conflicts. It made oversimplifications and exaggerations I had seen before. Even so, when Julia declares that the brain “stops producing dopamine” two years into a romantic relationship, then “starts producing oxytocin” I laughed. The guy beside me clapped, pointed at the screen, and exclaimed “exactly!” to his female companion. What the hell? Did he not see how insanely wrong that was? In fact, high sexual arousal floods the peripheral system with oxytocin (it actually cannot be measured in the brain) and couples tend to have the most frequent sex earlier in their relationships. Valentine’s dates hooted, snapped, blurted “See!” and seemed completely taken by the pretty pretty brain pictures on the screen. What were these humans doing?

At one point Julia is conducting an fMRI brain-imaging study on emotional-response differences in men and women, but the giant magnet is surrounded by dangerous metal, the subject’s head is not properly stabilized, and the images being reviewed are only pleasant ones. That might be okay if all you care about is how people respond to babies and bunnies, but usually we include negative images in studies of emotion. In other words: they got a lot of easy stuff wrong. “I hope I don’t know their consultant,” my conceited scientist brain decided.
> # The guy beside me clapped, pointed at the screen, and exclaimed “exactly!” to his female companion. What the hell? Did he not see how insanely wrong that was?

The plot thickens when poor, divorced, unemotional Julia is confronted by an attractive research subject. Now I’ll admit, this happens. I’m human, I notice … things. What I would never do is what Julia does next: her research assistant acquires his phone number, which Julia calls. They go on a date. Suspend my disbelief? She’s gonna get suspended by her university!

There is sex. Sex on drugs. Sex not happening. Bad sex. Greg, a professional basketball player, worries that his performance failures on the court might be translating to the bedroom. A little bad sex advice from an over-confident physical therapist leads him to confidently “take charge” during sex with his wife, with immediate consequence. Most of what we see in people who have sex counseling sessions is they’ve had some combination of bad sex information and poor communication with their partners, so these were remarkably more realistic than I expected. It was also good to see that the character who gets caught surreptitiously masturbating is, for once, the wife. She understands that sex is absolutely helpful in managing stress. We could have used a lesbian or poly person, but, when it comes to sex in movies, I like to keep the bar low. Not bad, *Female Brain*.

Someone clearly anticipated that the movie’s simplifications could spur accusations of sexism. Female characters say things like “I could set women back 60 years …” and “these stereotypical female qualities are actually strengths.” But it felt like shallow pandering. Research into gender differences is not sexist on its face, and female scientists are not afraid of finding differences in our research. Rather, gender differences depend on the context. For example, if women are likelier to make decisions informed by emotions, that might make them great at mediating a nasty divorce, because they can empathize with each side. But it could make them bad at driving a hard bargain for their mom’s funeral expenses, because too much emotion may just overwhelm the system. In any case, this all applies only to some women. There’s often less than five percentage points of difference that separate men and women in behavioral research.

The film’s message seems to be that we are powerless against our neurochemistry. Julia is a flood of certainty throughout the film, declaring “I rewired my brain already”; “you are in dopamine withdrawal”; and “I refuse to be a puppet to my neurochemicals.” In reality, neuroscientists live in probability land. We “might suggest” and find data “consistent with.” The good news is that “nature or nurture” died in science 30-ish years ago. Our genetics give our brain tendencies that are influenced by environment, so you can neither dominate your neurochemicals nor be dominated by them. The brain grows, adapts, and “rewires” with every experience, talk therapy, and masturbation session, and that is a good thing. This is how we learn.

# From Molecules to Megacities&#58; How Life Scales

## Geoffrey West’s monumental book “Scale” channels math and physics to explore the limits of our biology, our companies, and our civilization.

![Illustration by Nick Vokey, an ode to [“Powers of Ten”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)](1*HZuOzLGJL_0_K-HiIA3jYA.gif)*Illustration by Nick Vokey, an ode to [“Powers of Ten”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)*

What’s the difference between a book and a book review? Both are composed of words, and both ideally have some kind of narrative arc: an initial premise or question, some explication and examples, and a satisfying conclusion or call for further study. Is one simply longer than the other? Is a book something like a collection of book reviews strung together? Or does its size require a different internal structure? In a book you can explain things such as the fractal fourth dimension; in a review, you generally can only assert them.

This question may sound pedestrian, but it scales to fundamental questions around the nature of life and the possibility of sustainability on earth. How do the things in a universe, all composed of atoms, change in behavior and structure as they get larger? How do things that are alive as units (i.e. animals) scale differently from things “alive” as *interacting* units (i.e. cities and companies)?

These are the kinds of deep questions theoretical physicist Geoffrey West addresses in *Scale, [*a book](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314049/scale-by-geoffrey-west/9781594205583/) that ruminates on his own mortality and that of all living creatures and the cities and companies they create.

This book is about science, but it is full of people — both humanity at large, and individuals who stood on each other’s shoulders to apply the laws of physics and to discover/define quantitative laws for the complexities of living things. That idea has been unfolding in an exciting way for a long time, and West has been in the middle of most of it, first at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where his bosses allowed him to dabble in biology, and later at the Santa Fe Institute, where he still works.

![](1*quZYHzpLLTWRkCbRQGru_w.png)

At the scale of a book review, here is just a brief summary of West’s tour of a world perceived through the lens of physics and its laws of scaling. In essence, as we learned in school, if you double a line, it grows by a factor of two; double the side of a square, and its area grows by a factor of four; double the side of a cube, and its volume and mass will increase by a factor of eight.

Animals and cities and other organisms have complex internal structures whose different facets scale at different rates. For instance, as an animal’s overall mass grows, so do the length and size of its blood vessels, but the ending capillaries of a circulatory system are close to the same length and diameter in almost any animal, a function of the properties of blood. Similarly, rooms grow in number but not necessarily in size as a building gets larger. The electrical outlets are the same size throughout.

Big animals are not just like small ones but bigger; big ones live longer. The number of heartbeats in any animal’s lifetime is approximately the same — about 1.5 billion — so the hearts of large, long-lived animals beat much more slowly. A shrew’s heart beats roughly 1,500 times per minute, while the elephant operates at a ponderous 30 beats per minute. (Humans have become something of an outlier as we have extended our average lifespan to closer to 2.5 billion heartbeats with modern health measures — which may mean we have reached the limit. That’s a hotly debated question, of course.)

This all ties in with a different but complementary scaling in metabolic rates (how much energy it takes to keep a given mass of animal alive). For example, with each doubling of average weight, a species gets 25 percent more efficient metabolically and lives 25 percent longer. The physics of size and gravity also dictate certain other ratios: A mouse’s legs are tiny compared to its overall size, whereas an elephant needs broad stumps to stand on. Whales finesse the problem of supporting their mass by living in the sea.
> # For every doubling in residents, you need only 85 percent more infrastructure, but you get 115 percent more economic activity—and 115 percent more crime and disease.

West then proceeds to cities and companies, starting with humanity’s accelerating transition from hunting and gathering to farming to industry and urbanization and ultimately the digital everything/always-on phenomenon we’re dealing with now.

The big takeaway is that while companies get less innovative as they expand, cities foster innovation (presumably because of all the creative interactions). For every doubling in residents, you need only 85 percent more infrastructure, but you get 115 percent more economic activity—though you also get 115 percent more crime and disease.

As West puts it:
> In biology, the network principles underlying economies of scale … constrain the pace of life … and limit growth [generally creating equilibrium]. In contrast, cities and economies are driven by social interactions whose feedback mechanisms lead to the opposite behavior. The pace of life systematically increases with [a city’s] population size: diseases spread faster, businesses are born and die more often, and people even walk faster in larger cities. … Moreover, the social network dynamic …. leads to open-ended-growth. … Continuous adaptation, not equilibrium, is the rule.

Yet these rates of increase cannot last, says West. Cities use resources at a troubling rate, and he wonders how we can avert environmental crisis.

Indeed, West’s biggest concern is the sustainability of the planet. He easily debunks the already debunked Malthus, who expected humanity to run out of food, but he notes the astounding growth in energy consumption of modern humans. The challenge is not to control the population but to figure out how to bend the curve of their increasing activity.
[**Also from NEO.LIFE: Introducing the 3 Book List**
*Where we ask the experts for reading recommendations.](https://medium.com/neodotlife/three-books-90ba5d3f28f)*

Perhaps because I’m not a physicist, I’m less troubled by all this than West is. Like hunter-gatherer tribes, cities may be a temporary phenomenon, to be replaced by whatever you get when cities all flow into one another and cover the planet. The fundamental questions concern what we can change in this setup — and what we will do on purpose, carefully. Or will the changes happen *to* us? The scaling laws describe what happens now, but they still don’t exactly explain how or why. In essence, West doesn’t yet have all the answers, but he’s asking the right questions.

If cities connect across the planet into multi-node urban agglomerations, what laws will govern their use of energy and the interactions of their parts? Will new corporate structures such as markets and platforms (like eBay and Uber and Airbnb) change the physics of corporate growth and senescence? Will the new platform companies take control and live forever? Or will governments apply antitrust laws and change the “natural” outcomes? Indeed, the role of government is oddly missing from West’s book. One might conclude that national governments are irrelevant because cities more directly influence how we live. Yet they matter, both for their own unnatural laws and their propagation of culture.

In short, this is a masterful work. It does not neatly explain everything; rather, it elucidates the regularities amid the messiness. Whatever the reader’s particular area of interest, there’s something in here that’s relevant and prompts further thought.

For example, although West explains individual human growth — and how it stops as we change from a growth metabolism into a sustaining metabolism — there’s another phenomenon left untouched. Diabetes and obesity — and the concomitant other chronic diseases — result from a disturbance of that delicate metabolism; the laws West propounds no longer apply as many individuals continue to grow past puberty. This may be as big a threat to our future as the broader environmental issues that trouble West more.

Perhaps both books and book reviews should end not just with conclusions but with questions. Ideally a book teaches you a lot and makes you want to know more, whereas a book review teaches you a little and makes you want to read the book.

# Liver Failing? Grow Some New Ones

## A startup’s wild idea for creating organ factories in the body.

You might have to read this twice for it to sink in.

Instead of giving people liver transplants, doctors could inject liver cells into their lymph nodes so that auxiliary livers grow there.

![**A hepatocyte, a human liver cell, stained red and green. **(Courtesy of Lagasse Laboratory/McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine)](1*FCSN5hkC-JRdKdVoCvG9jQ.jpeg)***A hepatocyte, a human liver cell, stained red and green. **(Courtesy of Lagasse Laboratory/McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine)*

Strange as it might sound, it appears to work [in mice](http://discovermagazine.com/2012/mar/30-turning-lymph-nodes-into-liver-growing-factories), where the surrogate mini-livers made up for the missing function of a diseased liver. Tests in pigs have been encouraging, too, and now trials in humans could begin late in 2018 if Eric Lagasse and Michael Hufford can raise about $10 million for their startup, LyGenesis.

“I think there’s a real beauty and simplicity to this approach,” says Hufford, who is LyGenesis’s CEO.

Lagasse, a stem cell researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, came up with the idea over a decade ago in hopes of saving lives. In the United States alone, tens of thousands of people are diagnosed annually with a very serious liver problem, such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease, that prevents their bodies from properly filtering toxins. A liver transplant is generally their only option. But only [around 8,000](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/national-data/) liver transplants are performed every year, primarily because of [the difficulty of acquiring organs from donors](https://medium.com/neodotlife/egenesis-xenotransplants-organs-from-pigs-e0fb13a16f27).

The ideal solution would somehow tap directly into [the liver’s remarkable capacity for regeneration](http://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-medicine/focus-areas/liver-regeneration) — the organ can grow back even [after two-thirds of it is removed](http://share.upmc.com/2017/04/can-you-live-without-a-liver/). Indeed, other researchers [are testing methods](http://www.chp.edu/research/clinical-studies/liver-transplant/metabolic-disorder-liver-cell-transplant) of repairing livers by coaxing [healthy cells](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/06/403131/researchers-convert-cirrhosis-causing-cells-healthy-liver-cells-mice) to grow in place of diseased ones.

Lagasse questions how well such techniques can work in end-stage liver disease, when the organ is so scarred that it’s not very hospitable to new cells. It’s an “environment that is destroyed,” he says. But Lagasse noticed in experiments in mice that injected liver cells often survived just fine elsewhere in the body, away from the scarred liver. And they did especially well in lymph nodes.
[**Also from NEO.LIFE: Can Cloned Pigs Save Dying Humans? **
*Why replacement organs will be farmed before they’re printed.](https://medium.com/neodotlife/egenesis-xenotransplants-organs-from-pigs-e0fb13a16f27)*

You have about 600 lymph nodes in your body. They’re a key part of the immune system because they churn out T-cells. Lagasse’s idea is to hijack as few as three to six lymph nodes and use them as hospitable places for liver cells to reproduce.

In an outpatient procedure that would be far less invasive than a liver transplant, liver cells from a donor would be injected in lymph nodes in the patient’s abdomen, in connective tissue called the [mesentery](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-lymph-nodes/multimedia/mesentery/img-20007559) that shares blood vessels with the liver. In time, these lymph nodes would transform into mini-livers and perform their usual function of filtering the blood.

Experiments in mice and pigs indicate that these auxiliary livers can buy time for the original liver to repair itself or for a full transplant to become available— in which case, the lymph node livers shrink and eventually disappear. Incredibly, the body apparently will maintain no more liver than it needs for healthy function. It’s also intriguing that the lymph node-hijacking method [might also work](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2379) with thymus cells (which play a role in the immune system), kidney cells, and pancreatic cells that produce insulin.

Several big questions still need to be answered in human trials, which LyGenesis hopes to launch late next year under [a Food and Drug Administration program](https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/UCM585342.htm) that accelerates testing of regenerative technologies. Mini-livers grown in lymph nodes won’t necessarily perform as hoped. [Joe Zhou](https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/qiao-zhou-phd), a stem cell researcher at Harvard, said he was unfamiliar with Lagasse’s research but would be curious to see whether the auxiliary livers could grow large enough and have the right structure and links to the circulatory system to be effective.

And although advances in cell engineering could someday mean that a patient’s own cells could be injected into the lymph nodes, for now cells from a donor would still be required — along with immune-suppressing drugs that transplant recipients have to swallow to stave off organ rejection.

Lagasse and Hufford acknowledge the uncertainties but are optimistic they’re onto something big. Transplanting cells rather than entire livers would mean that one organ donor could supply 75 to 150 patients rather than just one. That would dramatically alter the grim math for people on the transplant waiting list.

# Happiness, 3-D Printed

## Happiness, 3-D Printed

### An industrial designer takes data visualization to a sculptural dimension.

Scott Summit calls it “the Global Homunculus”—a 3-D printed sculpture that doubles as a way to display data about every country.

Summit, an industrial designer and [entrepreneur in Amsterdam](http://www.summitid.com/), has been at the forefront of 3-D printing for a long time. He’s the kind of guy who, after tearing a ligament in his arm and dreading the traditional plaster cast his doctor was about to give him, used a 3-D printer [to make](https://www.ratemds.com/blog/healing-injuries-could-be-better-thanks-to-this-3-d-printed-cast/) an ultra-lightweight version that could get wet.

This globe project is practical in a different way: as a new means of making information tangible. In the version you see above (from three different angles), the countries that are popping out the furthest are the happiest places on earth.

The work begins with any spreadsheet that has data for every country. A 3-D printer can extrude each nation to a height determined by any value in the spreadsheet. So while this globe used data from the World Happiness Report, an annual [collection](http://worldhappiness.report/) of quality-of-life metrics published by the United Nations, he’d also like to use the technology to map immigration, war and peace, economic development, you name it. Summit says he’s inspired by seeing the “relationships between countries in a way that is neither digital or ephemeral, but instead, real and natural.”

## More on the Supposed Youth Pill

### A new study helps the case for a supplement known as NR, but it’s not yet a slam dunk.

There hasn’t been much evidence that taking a form of vitamin B known as NR, or nicotinamide riboside, makes you healthier. NR boosts the levels of a molecule called NAD, which plays a key role in cellular health, but it’s been unclear exactly what higher levels of NAD will do for you — and not just for a mouse.

Even so, NR is popular, and sales have been growing. People shell out $40 to $60 a month for supplies of NR pills that go by such brand names as Tru Niagen and Basis. Two companies that have both a rich scientific pedigree and the backing of billionaires, ChromaDex and Elysium Health, [have been brawling](https://medium.com/neodotlife/elysium-and-basis-vs-chromadex-and-tru-niagen-10264fca0bdb) in court over rights to sell the supposed wonder supplement. Both companies imply it’s an anti-aging pill; ChromaDex’s president calls NR a “once-in-two-lifetimes ingredient.”


That might prove to be true someday, but research published Thursday doesn’t make NR look revolutionary yet.

The study, [published in *Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03421-7)*, found that NR is safe to take in high doses for six weeks. It also helped reduce systolic blood pressure — the higher of the two numbers in a reading — by 10 points among participants who had somewhat elevated levels. It did not lower blood pressure for people who already had normal readings.

But the study was small — only 24 people completed it—in addition to being brief. So the finding did not reach statistical significance.

Nonetheless, both ChromaDex’s chief scientific officer and the lead scientist on the study say the new research confirms the supplement’s promise. “It’s very exciting,” says Charles Brenner, the company’s chief scientific adviser, who conducted early research on NR but was not directly involved in this study.

The 24 study participants took 1,000 milligrams a day of Niagen, four times what’s recommended on the bottle. “It’s like taking a bottle per week rather than per month,” Brenner says. But he adds that many customers are already taking more than what’s recommended. “Almost certainly, therapeutic doses will be higher than 250 milligrams per day,” he said in a follow-up email.

Although sometimes in medicine [less is more](https://medium.com/neodotlife/longeveron-stem-cells-for-frailty-aging-d94d8c9f2de6), the dose used in the study was based on amounts shown most effective in lab mice, says Christopher Martens, who led the research at the University of Colorado.

![](1*pxFcCsbJBgmI1bg-SxPciw.jpeg)

### Stress test

In the body, NR is converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which Brenner describes as “the central regulator of metabolism.”

NAD levels fall naturally with age, and many other factors can knock your NAD levels out of whack, including heart failure, brain diseases, alcohol, and even changing time zones, says Brenner, who is also the head of biochemistry and co-director of the Obesity Research and Education Initiative at the University of Iowa.

In his lab research, Brenner has found that NR reverses those negative effects in mice. “If you can give the animal that’s under this metabolic stress nicotinamide riboside, it’s going to allow the stressed tissues to restore their NAD level and improve their function,” he says.

The new study was the third published analysis of NR in people. Together the studies show that the supplement increases levels of NAD in the body. The link that’s yet to be confirmed is whether that extra NAD does anything good, and for whom.

“It’s pointing in the right direction, but here it’s not significant so we can’t draw any conclusions as good scientists,” says David Sinclair, a Harvard Medical School geneticist who works on similar research and has ties to Elysium.
> # “We need to conduct much larger-scale studies before I can recommend it to the masses.”

Sinclair, who also co-directs the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard, published [his own research last week](http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2818%2930152-1) in the journal *Cell*, showing that he could reverse the aging of blood vessels in mice. The loss of a protein called sirtuin 1, which can be triggered by the age-related decline of NAD, damages the vessels, the study found. Sinclair and his colleagues used an NAD precursor called nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN, to spur the reversal. (One of Martens’ co-authors has also studied supplementation with NMN and [found](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acel.12461) similar benefits in mice.)

Martens, now an assistant professor at the University of Delaware, says caloric restriction, which is known to extend life span in animals, works the same way — boosting NAD levels to improve cellular health and extend life. But caloric restriction is also known to trigger [bone loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26332798) and reduce [immune](http://jem.rupress.org/content/213/4/535) function. Martens, Brenner, and Sinclair all say that boosting NAD seems to have fewer side effects than restricting calories.

“Our study provides very promising evidence that NR may have some physiological benefits, but I don’t think that by themselves our data are the definitive measure of safety by any means,” says Martens. He received supplies of Niagen and some funding from ChromaDex for the recent study, but he developed the research plan and protocol independent of the company.

He says the suggestion from his study that Niagen might reduce blood pressure and blood vessel stiffness should be used to direct future research, rather than as evidence of Niagen’s effectiveness. There are 10 active [clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=nicotinamide+riboside&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=) involving nicotinamide riboside, looking at whether the supplement affects brain function, muscle metabolism, kidney injuries, metabolic health, the immune system, and the heart.

“We need to conduct much larger-scale studies in hundreds of people to confirm its safety,” Martens says, “before I can recommend it to the masses.”

*This story was updated on March 31, 2018, to correct that Brenner is ChromaDex’s chief scientific adviser, not chief scientific officer, and to clarify the description of the study’s findings in people with normal blood pressure.*

# Make the Hospital Come to You

## Make the Hospital Come to You

### A startup tries to scale up health care that’s cheaper, safer, and much more comfortable.

Shirley, an elderly woman with chronic lung disease, had just returned home after a month in the hospital and a rehab facility following hip surgery. Her two daughters who’d been caring for her were exhausted. Shirley was also dehydrated, suffering from the effects of pneumonia, a urinary tract infection, a potassium deficiency, and unstable blood pressure. Her stay at rehab had not rehabilitated her; in fact, she became more ill there. Her primary care doctor told her and her daughter Kyle that she needed to be readmitted to the hospital right away. Shirley felt so awful, she would have agreed to anything. But Kyle feared her mother would not survive another round of hospital and rehab. She insisted to the doctor that Shirley would not be going back.

To their astonishment and relief, the doctor informed them that there was another option: the hospital could be brought to Shirley’s home. Less than two hours later, a nurse practitioner, a nurse, and an emergency medical technician arrived to get her room set up — complete with a hospital bed, an IV, and monitors like you’d find in an intensive-care unit.


Shirley, who is my stepmother’s mother and asked that her last name stay private, became the 32nd of about 50 patients who have been served by a Boston-based company called Medically Home. Next to her bed, the company placed a phone and iPad. Shortly after, the face of Eliza “Pippa” Shulman appeared on the iPad screen. Shulman, Medically Home’s chief medical officer, introduced herself as the doctor who would be coordinating Shirley’s care throughout her “hospitalization.” With a touch of a button, Shirley or one of her family members could teleconference with her physician or nurse practitioner, any time, day or night. “It literally is a hospital at home,” says Kyle, “with fresh breezes through her windows and a fluffy comforter and sheets.”

Shirley also received in-person visits from a nurse, an occupational therapist, and a physical therapist. Another health care worker would knock and then let herself in at 8 a.m., five days a week. For five hours a day, she helped Shirley dress and bathe, cooked meals, and even did laundry.
> # It says a lot about the economics of operating a hospital that this model can make sense even with the costs of transporting people and equipment in and out of patients’ homes.

Bringing hospital equipment and personnel to someone’s home isn’t totally new. It’s somewhat common in Australia, and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine [has been developing](http://www.hospitalathome.org/about-us/history.php) hospital-at-home programs for two decades. But the idea hasn’t caught on widely because of “payment, attitudinal, and scalability issues,” as researchers who studied an earlier incarnation of Medically Home [wrote](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b16429_43c493f20fe546489a440da36fe881d5.pdf) in the *American Journal of Managed Care* in 2015. Now Medically Home is betting it can substantially expand the concept, as the costs of running hospitals continue to rise and as hospital-borne infections make hospital stays riskier.

Providing better service for less money sounds like an obvious premise in most industries, but it is radical in health care. Now Medically Home just has to prove it. Shirley’s insurance provider is one of only two payers in the Boston area that cover Medically Home’s program on a pilot basis. Medicare does not.

![**A nurse trainer, Scott Waite, and a nurse practioner, Janet Groth, in Mission Control.**](1*XZpBZUzGK-5344q0aWJD7w.jpeg)***A nurse trainer, Scott Waite, and a nurse practioner, Janet Groth, in Mission Control.***

### Cultural shift

Medically Home’s CEO, Richard Rakowski, is an energetic entrepreneur who has worked in multiple industries. He turned his focus toward new forms of health care delivery about 10 years ago, when he lost his father to a medical error in a hospital. In 2010, he launched a company called Clinically Home, which showed in a clinical pilot that combining hospital care at home with telemedicine was cheaper and reduced the likelihood of hospital readmission. The trial caught the eye of Atrius Health, a nonprofit health care provider based in Massachusetts. Clinically Home relaunched as Medically Home and moved from Connecticut to Boston to pursue a collaboration with Atrius.

Now, the Medically Home headquarters is one block from Fenway Park, in a sixth-floor space that the team calls Mission Control. The room has more in common with NASA than a hospital, Rakowski tells me. “Think of a rocket going into space. You have to be wired to all of the things going on in the rocket, to the astronaut,” he says. “Everything happening in the home we have to be able to see, monitor, communicate to and from.”

At Mission Control, nurses, doctors, and other care providers are bunched in the center of the room at desks that form a “pod.” All members of the pod work together, caring for up to 14 patients at a time. As the company expands, the room will be filled with more of these pods, each one a team in charge of its own set of patients from the beginning of their care to the end. “We don’t really believe that much in handoffs,” says Rakowski. Any time a patient or their family calls, the people in the pod should never have to say, “I don’t know, let me see if I can find a doctor and get back to you.”

The room buzzes with the low murmur of providers speaking with patients just quietly enough to protect their privacy. One exception is when the team celebrates something — like a previously homebound patient getting well enough to attend a grandchild’s graduation — with takeout lunch from a barbecue joint.

![](1*b2qX67i0-cJw5kjwHhgT1Q.png)

On the left wall are two rows of large curved screens, where employees can monitor the weather, the conditions of the roadways, and the status of deliveries to patients’ homes. Anywhere from one to five providers will visit a patient daily for laboratory testing, physical therapy, and even x-rays and meal delivery, just like in a hospital. The service is capped at one month, and the company will only deliver care in a socially stable environment, Rakowski says. For example, the home must be heated and the patient must be safe from violence.

It says a lot about the economics of operating a hospital that this model can make sense even with the costs of transporting people and equipment in and out of patients’ homes. A small 2005 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16330791) showed that for patients with certain conditions, caring for them at home was 32 percent cheaper than a hospital stay. “The fixed costs of hospitals are just utterly gargantuan,” says Ira Wilson, professor of health services, policy, and practice at Brown University. Though he was not familiar with Medically Home specifically, Wilson believes hospital-at-home care is not only viable but necessary. “One of the things we’ve got to figure out how to do in health care is to give people care in settings that provide all the resources that are necessary to treat the problem that they have — but not more,” he says.
> # Providing better service for less money sounds like an obvious premise in most industries, but it is radical in health care.

Medically Home also says its care is about 30 percent less expensive than a typical hospital stay. Yet even if the logic of the idea is clear, scaling it up remains one of the main challenges. Doug McCarthy, senior research director at the Commonwealth Fund, a health care research organization, cautions that a “cultural shift” will be needed for doctors to be confident enough to refer their patients to a company like Medically Home. “It’s going to take time and it’s going to take effort to integrate it successfully in our current system,” he says.

Medically Home has raised $14 million from investors and is now planning on expanding to Indiana and New Jersey. As for Shirley, three weeks were all she needed to get up and walking again. On her last day, Mission Control probably smelled like BBQ.

# Take These Drugs to Get to Mars

## Take These Drugs to Get to Mars

### Space brain and other cosmic problems demand new kinds of pharmaceutical protection.

I f humans are going to travel to Mars in the next decade or so, as NASA officially intends, it may take a medical breakthrough.

One of the biggest [unsolved problems](https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/bodyinspace) of space flight comes from very tiny stuff: high-speed, electrically charged particles of space radiation. Some of it flares off our own sun from time to time, and even in between those moments, space is filled with another kind, known as galactic cosmic rays: a low hum of heavy ions from beyond the solar system. Unlike electromagnetic radiation from X-ray machines, some of the most hazardous space radiation consists of protons and heavier — and thus more damaging — particles. It can wreak havoc on DNA, proteins, and other important molecules.


Astronauts probably can’t avoid it once they leave the protection of Earth’s magnetic field, which deflects most of space’s harmful particles. A metal shield strong enough to offer protection would probably make a spacecraft too heavy to fly.

And while it might be possible to [use gene therapy to make astronauts more radiation-resistant](https://medium.com/neodotlife/genetically-engineering-an-astronaut-fea011089684), there’s little chance of that happening in time for NASA to meet its stated goal of sending humans to Mars by the 2030s.

In the meantime, our best answer may be drugs.

For example, experiments with mice suggest that a drug called CDDO, which enhances the body’s ability to repair DNA and respond to inflammation, can reduce the risk of radiation-induced cancer, says Jerry Shay, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas, Southwestern. The drug is already undergoing clinical trials as a cancer therapy.

“Once it’s approved for these human disorders, it will be very simple based on our published data and that of others to convince NASA that maybe this is something they should take on a long-term space mission,” says Shay, who is also a paid member of the scientific advisory board at Reata, the company that makes CDDO.
> # The most immediate threat to a Mars mission might be “space brain.” A mind that’s less than sharp can jeopardize the whole mission.

While cancer takes years to develop, the most immediate threat to a Mars mission might be so-called [space brain](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-radiation-be-a-deal-breaker-for-mars-missions/). “The only functional outcome that NASA cares about is cognition,” says Charles Limoli, a biologist at the University of California, Irvine. He’s found that after mice are exposed to radiation, the fingerlike extensions that branch off their neurons, called dendrites, are [shorter and less extensive](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34774). Studies also show radiation makes mice forgetful, more anxious, and less social. A mind that’s anything less than sharp can jeopardize the whole mission.

But solutions are in the works. In May, researchers led by Susanna Rosi at the University of California, San Francisco, found that an anti-inflammatory drug called PLX5622, which has undergone clinical trials to treat rheumatoid arthritis, seemed to prevent long-term memory loss in mice exposed to radiation. Previous research suggested that radiation affects the brain’s immune cells, called microglia, which are killed by PLX5622. Rosi’s team [found](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26039-7#Abs1) that killing the microglia in irradiated mice, and then allowing the brain to regrow the cells anew, prevented those animals from losing memory.

That research is promising, Limoli says, but because the drug has such a wide target — it wipes out almost an entire class of cells — it probably won’t be what NASA ultimately uses. His group also has found positive [results](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31545) with PLX5622 but has been researching several other options to alleviate space brain.** **Those drugs increase antioxidants, reduce inflammation, or affect how certain genes in the brain are activated, or expressed.

![](1*SCKCTh-vJ2xcYbtwTH1c7w.png)

Because clinical trials require so much time and so many resources, NASA will ideally repurpose drugs that are already FDA-approved for cancer or other conditions. But how effective they’ll be in space isn’t clear—there are [limitations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-018-0043-2) to Earth-based studies. Even the best experiments down here, such as those at NASA’s Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory, can’t fully recreate the experience of being pelted with galactic cosmic rays.

Without knowing specifically how space radiation harms humans, it’s hard to identify precise pharmaceutical remedies, says Jeff Chancellor, a physicist at Texas A&M University. He adds that there’s not yet enough evidence to know for sure whether space radiation poses a prohibitive risk. “My gut is telling me we’re overestimating it,” says Chancellor, whose wife is an astronaut scheduled to return from the International Space Station in December.

“Maybe we’ll find out the human body adapts,” he says. “It’s a pretty amazing machine.”

# Machine Learning Illuminates the Body’s Dark Matter

## Machine Learning Illuminates the Body’s Dark Matter

### A startup finds patterns that experts in personalized medicine say they couldn’t see before.

![**Larry Smarr says the technology unlocked new insights about the microbiome. **(Illustration by Nick Vokey; photo courtesy of RogDel/Wikipedia)](1*lWtpU6iDHflgCW_BTWsfCQ.jpeg)***Larry Smarr says the technology unlocked new insights about the microbiome. **(Illustration by Nick Vokey; photo courtesy of RogDel/Wikipedia)*

When it comes to using computers to analyze medical data, it takes a lot to impress Larry Smarr.

Smarr, a computer scientist at a UC San Diego/UC Irvine research institute called Calit2, is a pioneer of the quantified-self movement. He regularly analyzes his blood and stool for 150 biomarkers. If he notices something odd, he’ll adjust his daily activity, whether that means taking a few extra laps around campus to burn more calories or tweaking the strain of probiotic he’s supplementing with. Thanks to all this data, a few years ago he realized he had Crohn’s disease before his doctor did—and when he eventually needed surgery for the condition, he supplied his surgeon with a 3-D model of his colon so she could familiarize herself with the layout before the operation.


Because Smarr is so well-versed in amassing and analyzing medical data, it was striking to hear that a new machine-learning startup, Pattern Computer, had something new to show him.

One of Smarr’s obsessions is the interplay of bacteria in our gut—[our microbiome](https://medium.com/neodotlife/review-of-daytwo-microbiome-test-deacd5464cd5)—and how little we know about it. (“The dark matter of the body,” he calls it.) Smarr is trying to figure out which shifts and fluctuations in the microbiome are normal, and which might cause disease. To do that, he and colleagues compared the gut bacteria of healthy people to the microbiomes of people with various stages of inflammatory bowel disease. Even with only 62 people providing samples in this study, it generated a massive amount of data, because the bacteria in our guts produce about 10,000 different kinds of proteins that each perform a different biological function. And the relative abundance of these protein families varied in each of the human subjects.

It’s been known that a certain subset of these protein families is less common in people with IBD than in healthy people. But when Smarr gave Pattern Computer that data, it was able to [narrow down the subset substantially](http://www.patterncomputer.com/img/pdf/KEGGs_5.22_final.pdf). It turned out that nine of those 10,000 protein families appeared to be the most associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Zeroing in on those nine and their biochemical pathways could offer new clues about the ways our microbiome affects our health and open up new interventions.

“That was really a discovery,” Smarr says. After looking at this data for years with a variety of software tools, he had not noticed “the pattern that was blocked inside of this big mess of data points.”

That’s Pattern Computer’s promise: that its machine-learning system can find correlations that other systems can't, even when it hasn’t been told what to look for. The company is led by tech forecaster [Mark Anderson](https://www.futureinreview.com/topics/leaders/mark-anderson/) and launched this week with around $6 million in funding and clients that range from “companies to countries,” he says. With time, it’ll move into different industries, Anderson adds, but right now it’s focusing on biomedicine.

![**Mark Anderson, left, with Smarr at the Pattern Computer launch**.](1*eXKZ0rJn1qprLBJvCMzSnA.jpeg)***Mark Anderson, left, with Smarr at the Pattern Computer launch**.*

It has a lot of competition. Medical researchers, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and doctors are trying a wide range of advanced computing techniques to try to find insights in data. What’s especially tricky is that this data [comes in many forms](http://blog.gnshealthcare.com/data-interoperability-sharing-access-healthcare), from the quantities in blood tests to the readouts of genomes to the text in journal articles and patient records. Neither Pattern Computer nor any other single company or algorithm is likely to master all of it. IBM has shown as much. Despite lots of hype about how its Watson technologies—based on the system that won on *Jeopardy!—*are being used at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and other hospitals, they’ve done little to change how doctors diagnose and treat disease.

Progress in using machine learning in medicine is instead coming in smaller steps. Ben Brown, a computational biologist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is trying to discover how interactions between genes lead to breast cancer. But because there is such wide variation in breast cancer tumors, it's impossible for us to study all the relevant gene interactions "by brute force,” Brown says. He has used Pattern Computer’s technology to [find a three-way gene interaction](http://www.patterncomputer.com/img/pdf/Biomed-TechnicalArticle-BC_merged_revoff.pdf) that is correlated with low cancer survival rates. Follow-up research could explore targeted therapies for that interaction.

### **Higher resolution**

In 2009, Leroy Hood, one of the developers of gene-sequencing technology and a trailblazer for a comprehensive view of health called “systems biology,” wrote [an article for *Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/doctors-vision-future-medicine-80793)* called “A Doctor's Vision of the Future of Medicine.” In the future he imagined, people were testing their own blood with at-home devices, allowing their doctors to analyze mind-boggling amounts of information about their health, down to the level of genes. That article was set in … June 2018.

We’re not where Hood envisioned we’d be by now, because only part of the equation has arrived. “We have enormous amounts of data,” Hood says. “We’re just beginning to scratch the surface of what we can do with it.”

![](1*rYXXt94A53XD1G50Y7jtKQ.png)

Through a health-coaching service called [Arivale](https://medium.com/neodotlife/lee-hood-arivale-d1157f204c4a) and other research, Hood is devoted to bringing about what he calls P4 medicine: predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory. The challenge, as he put it, is to analyze data of many different types. As an example, he pointed to a P4 pilot study on 108 of his friends. For nine months, his team gathered information on them by sequencing their genome, taking regular blood and stool tests, and giving them self-trackers for their sleep and physical activity. To fully make sense of the data and pull several actionable suggestions from it, Hood says he’ll need more tools like Pattern Computer’s.

Smarr notes that the breakthrough Pattern Computer made in his research is just “one experiment.” To be sure, the startup might prove to play a small role in the advance of data-driven medicine. But Hood says he’s optimistic that P4 could be a reality before long. Finally, he says, researchers can “look at data and disease with a resolution we’ve never had before.”

# The Misguided Pessimism of “Homo Deus”

## Yuval Noah Harari’s book is right that humans have developed God-like powers, but it’s wrong about the reasons — and it underestimates what will come.

![Illustration by Ellen van Engelen](1*kbUqb2a1OKfd2dMUburjbA.jpeg)*Illustration by Ellen van Engelen*

Data is, literally, the new God. At least according to Yuval Noah Harari. In *Homo Deus*, his sweeping overview of the past, present and future of the human species, this [medieval military historian](http://www.ynharari.com/about/) reminds me of a great debater, one who lays out his case with zero doubts. The result is a fascinating, challenging, entertaining and infuriating read.

Harari attempts to explain comprehensively why centuries of decisions and actions by humans have led in a linear way to *Homo deus — *a God-like human who nonetheless has no meaning and will soon be rendered irrelevant and ultimately eliminated. Channeling his inner existentialist, Harari argues that modernity can be summarized in a single phrase: “humans agree to give up meaning, in exchange for power.” In his view, “every organism — including *Homo sapiens* — is an assemblage of organic algorithms … and there is no reason to think that organic algorithms can do things that non-organic algorithms will never be able to duplicate or surpass.” I suppose I had expected a lot of biology alongside the history and sociology, but this book turns out to be more of an IT-AI treatise, based on the premise that all organisms are just algorithms and life is a simple data-processing continuum. (Perhaps our world is destined to become the *Matrix*-like simulation that some Silicon Valley heavyweights believe we are already living within?)

As a historian, Harari has focused on when life was most decidedly nasty, brutish and short. So it is not surprising that he paints a picture of a doomed humanity. Given nuclear weapons, and our ability to alter broad swaths of our climate and environment, this prediction may not be entirely unjustified. But it is not foreordained. It’s also possible that, despite recent elections, we are evolving into a gentler, less violent, more empathetic, better educated and more successful species. The evening news doesn’t lead with the impact of all the United Nations millennium goals being met. And yet those long-term trends tell us a whole lot more about where almost all of humanity is headed — which may turn out to be a far more optimistic tale than that painted by Harari.

One has to wonder whether Harari’s conclusions would not be so dire had his initial historical focus been on the peak of Greek ingenuity, the Renaissance or the emergent computer-biological age. Our rapidly emerging ability to alter life may lead to a fundamental redesign of parts of humanity that don’t end in disaster and enslavement but instead allow us to live a healthier life, perhaps even on very different planets as we explore the Milky Way. We now understand how organisms thrive in the equivalent of boiling battery acid or very high-radiation environments. We have very rough blueprints that tell us that a fundamental redesign of a conscious human, for a very different environment, is increasingly feasible.

While Harari is an extraordinarily broad-thinking and smart individual, biology is not a field he’s very comfortable in. Nor is evolution, especially human-driven evolution. If one is to truly describe a human species with God-like powers, one might focus on a *Homo evolutis*, an emerging species that has ever-greater powers to determine what lives and dies on this planet, and soon on other planets.
> # We are becoming a *Homo deus*, but not because we are algorithms. It’s because we are fundamentally redesigning our species and a vast number of other species. We are redesigning life itself.

After nearly four billion years of Darwinian evolution, we have created a separate and independent evolutionary logic. Whereas what lived and died used to depend only on natural selection and random mutation, now at least half of what lives and dies is due to human selection. A cornfield is a good example of completely unnatural selection; absent humans, no single species would grow in orderly rows, eliminating almost all other life forms, not even being able to self-reproduce. Absent humans, likely there would not be a whole lot of Lhasa Apsos. About half of what lives on our planet today depends on our decisions, what we find cute, useful, beautiful or harmful.

Our newfound powers take the randomness out of genetics and ensure directed evolution. For instance, “gene drives” ensure that every descendant of a particular species expresses a particular genetic trait. In practical terms, this means we can now eliminate every Zika- or malaria-causing mosquito and every Lyme disease-carrying tick. As J. Robert Oppenheimer once reminded us, quoting from the Bhagavad Gita, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” because one group, acting in the hinterlands of Brazil or in the Florida Keys makes a decision on the life or death of a whole species.

As we acquire the power to destroy, we also acquire the power to create. By resurrecting extinct species like bucardos, passenger pigeons, dodos and even woolly mammoths, we can revive and restore what we crushed out of existence. And, thanks to folks like [Floyd Romesberg](http://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/), we are even altering the most fundamental code of life, by creating self-reproducing species that are not written in the four letters of DNA (A, T, C and G), which heretofore coded all independent life forms on the planet. By creating separate evolutionary branches that code in ATXY, or in ATCGXY, Romesberg *et al* prove we can create completely separate evolutionary trees, unlike anything “natural” on this planet thus far. One need only go peruse the poster presentations at iGEM, the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition, to understand that high school and college students are already acting as miniature gods, with teams like the one from Tokyo University that is attempting to slightly modify bacteria so as to terraform other planets to our needs and specifications.

What this means is that we are becoming a *Homo deus*, but not because we are algorithms. It’s because we are fundamentally redesigning our species and a vast number of other species. We are redesigning life itself. We are becoming a *Homo deus* because we can use instruments like CRISPR to modify our own gene code such that we may birth the next human species. But why stop there? Our god-like technology to redesign life could lead to multiple human species on this and other planets. That is a somewhat terrifying prospect, if, as Harari points out, purely data-driven, algorithmic hominids were to treat us as we have treated our closest relatives: chimps, bonobos, orangutans and gorillas.

Harari’s book is strangely earth-anchored during a period in which we have discovered hundreds of planets, some of which may be habitable, but which require a fundamental redesign of our humanity to reach and thrive on. By largely ignoring biological evolution in favor of algorithm evolution, Harari misses out on some of the urgent ethical-science questions that we now face. That leaves a very large hole in the blueprints of what a Human-God can become, how fast, and in which direction. Reducing life to a series of programmable, mathematical equations ignores humanity’s greatest superpower, our ability to shape and determine what lives and dies, how life forms are shaped, modified, and recreated.

Despite the lack of emphasis on biology, Harari’s book is really important. It brings up fundamental questions about ethics and morals, about what it is to be human, about where we came from and where we are going. It’s the kind of book you want to read on paper, so as to make it easier to scribble in the margins as you agree with, debate, underline or cross out the text. If you like to debate, especially uncomfortable, complex ideas, it is well worth your while to spar with a mind like Harari’s.

# The Genetically Engineered Astronaut

## Can we create people who are optimized for ultra-long space travel?

![(NASA/Framepool)](1*vmYn7gRFhwUhnrWMzS91WA.gif)*(NASA/Framepool)*

All astronauts need the right stuff. But to live on Mars or go even further in space, eventually it might be necessary to *create* the right stuff than to try to find people who have it.

In other words, what if you could make the ideal astronaut from scratch?

Even with advances in understanding the human genome and with editing tools like CRISPR, genetically engineering the perfect astronaut is still just a thought experiment. But the idea isn’t as wild as you may think.

Some researchers like [Christopher Mason](http://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/profile.php?id=mason), a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, are already looking into it. He has outlined a [500-year plan](http://2011.igem.org/Team:NYC_Software/Tools/Colonization) to edit and write entire genomes to make people better suited for colonizing outer space. The plan suggests we use synthetic biology to make other planets more like Earth and then, in the 24th century, “begin shipment of humans to these new worlds.”

Mason’s research so far focuses on enhancing physiological traits like genetic resilience to radiation. He’s tinkering with a gene called [*p53](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/p53-the-most-frequently-altered-gene-in-14192717)*, which may provide protection from cosmic radiation. His team is also trying to learn from the genetic survival secrets of organisms like tardigrades — the tiny animal called a water bear — which can withstand radiation, temperatures near absolute zero, and even the vacuum of space.

But mental traits may be more important. To stay sane even on a relatively close trip to Mars, astronauts will have to get along well with other people in a confined space for a couple of years. They’ll have to be resilient, with the flexibility and creativity to solve unforeseen problems. They’ll also need to be introverts who are both comfortable socializing with crewmates and fine being alone when others don’t want to be bothered. And they’ll have to handle the isolation of being millions of miles from Earth.
> # Variants in six genes are correlated with extroversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness.

What’s tricky is that genes don’t directly shape your personality. Instead, genetics “influences the way that environment shapes personality,” says [Peter Suedfeld](https://psych.ubc.ca/persons/peter-suedfeld/), a psychiatrist at the University of British Columbia who has consulted with NASA and the Canadian Space Agency. So engineering a genome could at least maximize the chances you’ll get an astronaut with the optimal personality. Combining that with the right environment and training, you could conceivably create the best possible astronaut.

Scientists have only recently begun to unravel the genetic basis for personality, scanning genomes and hunting for correlations between traits and differences in individual letters of DNA, called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. Last year, researchers analyzed genetic data from about 200,000 people and [found](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3736) variants in six genes that are correlated to different extents with extroversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness.

A [smaller study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27595594), involving 2,500 people, identified a genetic variant that correlated with having positive emotions, an important component of psychological resilience. Yet another genomic study of 10,000 people looked at [loneliness](https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2016197), estimating that it may be only 27 percent genetic at best, suggesting environment is the dominant factor.

These studies are preliminary, however. One limitation is that they rely on self-reported questionnaires. “So there’s a lot of noise,” says [Aliza Wingo](http://psychiatry.emory.edu/faculty/wingo_aliza.html), a psychiatrist at Emory University who was part of the resilience study.

A personality trait likely involves hundreds or thousands of genes, and to find the rest, researchers will need much more data — which are now becoming available. The [U.K. Biobank](http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), for example, contains genomes and data on 500,000 people. The U.S. National Institutes of Health is recruiting a million volunteers to fill its own database as part of its Precision Health Initiative, [launched in 2015](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/01/obama-precision-medicine-plan-would-create-huge-us-genetic-biobank).

Perhaps in a couple of decades, Wingo says, researchers will be able to identify all the genes responsible for personality. But while genomic information may help choose who goes to Mars, modifying those genes won’t be straightforward. Our genes are intertwined, each potentially influencing personality in many ways. “We don’t know the unintended consequences of editing so many genes,” says [Chi-Hua Chen](http://profiles.ucsd.edu/chi-hua.chen), a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who led the larger personality study.
> # One geneticist envisions that in the 24th century, it will be time to “begin shipment of humans to new worlds.”

The researchers found, for example, that extroversion was genetically correlated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Openness was associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and neuroticism was linked to conditions like depression and anxiety. A [different study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/23/050682) looking at empathy — which is related to desired traits like agreeableness — found a genetic correlation with anorexia and schizophrenia. So even if you could balance every trait and engineer the optimal psyche for an astronaut, there’s no guarantee of a perfectly well-adjusted individual.

Then again, maybe that’s OK. The unpredictability and intangibility of personality are huge parts of what makes us human. If we want a drama-free mission to Mars, we should just stick with robots.

# Meat Doesn’t Grow on Trees—But Maybe It Could

## Meat Doesn’t Grow on Trees—But Maybe It Could

### What if your steak came from the greenhouse instead of the slaughterhouse?

T o make meat out of animal cells but no actual animals, you have to solve a big (meaty!) problem: Where do you grow the stuff?

Though it might sound like a vegetarian’s nightmare, the answer could be to produce the meat on plants.

Glenn Gaudette is seeing if he can make that happen. A professor of biomedical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, Gaudette is growing cow muscle cells on spinach leaves.

It’s early days — Gaudette told NEO.LIFE at the New Harvest conference at MIT last Friday that he will have data in a couple of weeks. But experts in the field of lab-grown meat (also known as “cultured meat” or “clean meat”) say that Gaudette could be addressing one of [the technology](https://medium.com/neodotlife/corby-kummer-on-finless-foods-80fdfec10e14)’s big problems. Plant leaves could give cultured meat a scaffold that also happens to be edible.


Brian Spears, CEO of the startup New Age Meats in San Francisco, heard the idea for the first time in Gaudette’s presentation at New Harvest. “That was really exciting,” he says. “We’re going to try that.”

Growing meat without using the body of an animal might be more environmentally sustainable. But the meat cells [need to multiply on a structure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4648904/) that supplies them with nutrients, as blood vessels do in an animal.

Joshua Gershlak, a graduate student working with Gaudette, pointed out that plants feed their cells with blood-vessel-like structures with the same branching patterns seen in animal tissue. So they used detergents to strip the plant cells away from spinach leaves, a process called decellularization. What’s left behind looks like a spinach leaf, but it’s pale white and has a texture like Styrofoam. Last year [they coaxed](http://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2017/03/30/spinach-heart-gaudette) human stem cells to grow into beating heart tissue on this spinach skeleton—work that might have implications for tissue regeneration technologies. Now they are trying to get cow stem cells to develop into the muscle cells that make up a tasty steak or hamburger.

Various other materials exist for growing cultured meat. Some that work well as scaffolds, including materials known as hydrogels, are not necessarily edible, meaning some other step will be needed to remove the meat. As for the edible options, there are silk, chitosan (from shrimp and other crustaceans), zein (from corn), and alginate (from seaweed). “But whether cells grow well on them is another matter,” says [Marianne Ellis](http://www.bath.ac.uk/profiles/faculty-of-engineering-design-associate-dean-learning-and-teaching-marianne-ellis/), of the University of Bath, a biochemist and tissue engineer who is collaborating with Gaudette.

![**A decellularized spinach leaf (left) and one with bovine blood in it, which could nurture the growth of a cow’s meat cells. **(Courtesy of Glenn Gaudette)](1*Ioi7SanpTx8mXsFBg7peuA.jpeg)***A decellularized spinach leaf (left) and one with bovine blood in it, which could nurture the growth of a cow’s meat cells. **(Courtesy of Glenn Gaudette)*

Even though growing meat on leaves could be cheap and clean, there are big obstacles. The most fundamental is that no one knows how well animal stem cells grow on plant skeletons, because no one has tried it. “Stem cells are notoriously finicky,” says Spears. To grow into the kind of cells that make up a sausage or steak, the cells need to not only grow and thrive, but they must also differentiate properly into skeletal muscle cells, and not veer off into some other kind of cell or revert to stem cells.

Stephanie Wallis, [chief scientific officer of Higher Steaks](https://www.highersteaks.com/team/), a cultured meat company in London, says she believes cultured muscle cells won’t grow properly if the scaffold doesn’t have the exact right shape or provide the proper distance between cells. Stem cells too densely packed will die, become unhealthy, or differentiate into the wrong kind of cell.

Plant leaves have a structure that can’t be manipulated and customized as easily as other scaffolding materials, says Wallis. But there’s a chance that’s OK: plants come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and maybe one of those is already perfect for growing cultured meat. Gaudette and Gershlak have decellularized not only spinach but also [other kinds of leaves](https://www.wpi.edu/news/wpi-team-grows-heart-tissue-spinach-leaves), including parsely.

To grow meat this way, researchers will need to ensure that the detergents used to strip the plant cells away don’t leave any residue that’s either harmful or bad-tasting.

Ellis says she and her students can’t yet test whether plant-based scaffolds affect the taste of cultured meat, either for better or worse. Because food isn’t allowed in most scientific labs, she says, “they’re not allowed to eat the research yet.”

# Check Out This Beating Mini-Heart in a Jar

## Check Out This Beating Mini-Heart in a Jar

### It’s made out of living human cells. Someday they could be yours.

The human heart is special. That’s not some bad poetry: it’s a tricky truth in medical research. Time and time again, drugs that look promising in experiments on animals are no good for humans. And often it’s because a compound that is harmless to a mouse heart is toxic to the human heart. Other rodent organs more closely approximate ours, but the structure and the physics of our hearts—all the way down to the minute details of how calcium ions flow—are simply too different.

That’s why a company called Novoheart developed this miniature human heart in a jar. OK, it’s just a portion of a heart—an organoid—grown from human stem cells. But it’s hollow and it beats. When any compound is added to the container, researchers can get clues about its safety by analyzing how well the organoid conducts electricity and how strongly it contracts.

One of Novoheart’s first clients is Pfizer, which is studying a drug that might treat a neuromuscular disorder called Friedreich’s ataxia. Novoheart got cells from two people who have the disease and coaxed those cells to grow over about four months into cardiac organoids. Someday, says Kevin Costa, Novoheart’s chief scientist, your doctor might order up organoids from your own cells to help determine which drugs are best for you.

# Shake Up the Snow Globe in Your Mind

## Shake Up the Snow Globe in Your Mind

### Michael Pollan explores the neuroscience of psychedelics in this excerpt from his new book.

What does a high-entropy brain look like? The various scanning technologies that an Imperial College lab has used to map the brains of people on psychedelic drugs show that the specialized neural networks of the brain — such as the default mode network and the visual processing system — each become disintegrated, while the brain as a whole becomes more integrated as new connections spring up among regions that ordinarily kept mainly to themselves or were linked only via the central hub of the default mode network. Put another way, the various networks of the brain became less specialized.

“Distinct networks became less distinct under the drug,” Imperial College’s head of psychedelic research, Robin Carhart-Harris, and his colleagues have [written](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-27/edition-9/how-do-hallucinogens-work-brain), “implying that they communicate more openly” with other brain networks. “The brain operates with greater flexibility and interconnectedness under hallucinogens.”


In a 2014 paper [published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3909994/) in the *Journal of the Royal Society Interface*, the Imperial College team demonstrated how the usual lines of communications within the brain are radically reorganized when the default mode network goes off-line and the tide of entropy is allowed to rise. Using a scanning technique called magnetoencephalography, which maps electrical activity in the brain, the authors produced a map of the brain’s internal communications during normal waking consciousness and after an injection of psilocybin. In its normal state, the brain’s various networks talk mostly to themselves, with a relatively few heavily trafficked pathways among them.

But when the brain operates under the influence of psilocybin, thousands of new connections form, linking far-flung brain regions that during normal waking consciousness don’t exchange much information. In effect, traffic is rerouted from a relatively small number of interstate highways onto myriad smaller roads linking a great many more destinations. The brain appears to become less specialized and more globally interconnected, with considerably more intercourse, or “cross talk,” among its various neighborhoods.
> # The increase in entropy allows a thousand mental states to bloom, many of them bizarre and senseless, but some number of them revelatory and imaginative.

There are several ways this temporary rewiring of the brain may affect mental experience. When the memory and emotion centers are allowed to communicate directly with the visual processing centers, it’s possible our wishes and fears, prejudices and emotions, begin to inform what we see — a hallmark of primary consciousness and a recipe for magical thinking. Likewise, the establishment of new linkages across brain systems can give rise to synesthesia, as when sense information gets cross-wired so that colors become sounds or sounds become tactile. Or the new links give rise to hallucination, as when the contents of my memory transformed my visual perception of Mary into María Sabina, or the image of my face in the mirror into a vision of my grandfather. The forming of still other kinds of novel connections could manifest in mental experience as a new idea, a fresh perspective, a creative insight, or the ascribing of new meanings to familiar things — or any number of the bizarre mental phenomena people on psychedelics report. The increase in entropy allows a thousand mental states to bloom, many of them bizarre and senseless, but some number of them revelatory, imaginative, and, at least potentially, transformative.

![](1*8SwdROubvStbpCVptRwIVw.jpeg)

One way to think about this blooming of mental states is that it temporarily boosts the sheer amount of diversity in our mental life. If problem solving is anything like evolutionary adaptation, the more possibilities the mind has at its disposal, the more creative its solutions will be. In this sense, entropy in the brain is a bit like variation in evolution: it supplies the diversity of raw materials on which selection can then operate to solve problems and bring novelty into the world. If, as so many artists and scientists have testified, the psychedelic experience is an aid to creativity — to thinking “outside the box” — this model might help explain why that is the case. Maybe the problem with “the box” is that it is singular.

A key question that the science of psychedelics has not even begun to answer is whether the new neural connections that psychedelics make possible endure in any way, or if the brain’s wiring returns to the status quo ante once the drug wears off. The finding by Roland Griffiths’s lab that the psychedelic experience leads to long-term changes in the personality trait of openness raises the possibility that some kind of learning takes place while the brain is rewired and that it might in some way persist. Learning entails the establishment of new neural circuits; these get stronger the more exercise they get. The long-term fate of the novel connections formed during the psychedelic experience — whether they prove durable or evanescent — might depend on whether we recall and, in effect, exercise them after the experience ends. (This could be as simple as recollecting what we experienced, reinforcing it during the integration process, or using meditation to reenact the altered state of consciousness.)

![](1*o_nYAhmPF7aQzcJFEPQr2A.png)

Franz Vollenweider has suggested that the psychedelic experience may facilitate “neuroplasticity”: it opens a window in which patterns of thought and behavior become more plastic and so easier to change. His model sounds like a chemically mediated form of cognitive behavioral therapy. But so far this is all highly speculative; as yet there has been little mapping of the brain before and after psychedelics to determine what, if anything, the experience changes in a lasting way.

Carhart-Harris argues in the entropy paper that even a temporary rewiring of the brain is potentially valuable, especially for people suffering from disorders characterized by mental rigidity. A high-dose psychedelic experience has the power to “shake the snow globe,” he says, disrupting unhealthy patterns of thought and creating a space of flexibility — entropy — in which more salubrious patterns and narratives have an opportunity to coalesce as the snow slowly resettles.

# The End of Hangovers

## The End of Hangovers

### Leave it to the Brits to invent a synthetic alcohol that gets you properly pickled and doesn’t make you feel poisoned.

I f a chemist were to design the world’s most popular recreational drug from scratch, alcohol would be a pretty terrible choice.

We’re all more than familiar with the physical dangers and social catastrophes: car accidents, girls passed out on the train, street brawls, regrettable office holiday parties. But there’s also the basic toxicity of alcohol — especially the byproduct created by the liver, acetaldehyde. 
 
We know instinctively that acetaldehyde is a poison. The muscle aches and [misery of a hangover](https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/drugs-alcohol/hangover4.htm) make this painfully obvious. Yet the true physical impacts of alcohol — such as its contribution to over [15 kinds of cancer](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.76.1155), in addition to liver cirrhosis and brain damage — are little discussed.


There’s a reason for that, says David Nutt, director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit in the Division of Brain Sciences at Imperial College in London, who is leading an initiative to make a safer alternative. “The drinks industry has worked hard to underplay the impacts of alcohol, so the public is kept ignorant,” he says. “And to be fair, most of us don’t want to know, because we like to drink.”

We all know about the cardiovascular benefits of red wine, but those benefits vanish if you consume too much (more than one glass a day for women, three for men). Nonetheless, the stress relief that comes with alcohol is significant.

That’s why Nutt has been trying for 10 years to develop something with all the pros and few of the cons: a synthetic version of alcohol that provides the same warm, lubricating effect in the brain but is not carcinogenic or toxic, cannot make you truly drunk, or give you a hangover — and has no calories to boot. 
 
To make such a dream compound, Nutt has examined over 80 chemicals. Finally he thinks he’s found the winner and is looking to raise £7 million in initial investment for his startup, Alcarelle.
[**Also from NEO.LIFE: Millennials’ Sobriety Isn’t What It Seems**
*They’re avoiding many of the substances that got earlier generations high. But are they better off?](https://medium.com/neodotlife/millennials-and-drugs-23aa24b8fb1d)*

Nutt won’t reveal much about what this compound is or why it has the properties he seeks, lest someone else get to market with it first. Pretty much all we know is that it’s a chemical you could add to other liquids, such as juice.

If it really does work, it’s easy to see why demand would be high. With [Millennials drinking and smoking less](https://medium.com/neodotlife/millennials-and-drugs-23aa24b8fb1d) than any generation in recent history, there’s an obvious market. Women would find it especially appealing: we have less of the enzyme that processes booze, alcohol dehydrogenase, which mean hangovers can be especially brutal, and the risks of infertility and breast cancer are particularly severe. Plus, about one-third of people in Japan, Korea, China, and Vietnam have a genetic variation that means they cannot process alcohol properly and get severe headaches within hours of drinking.
 
Nutt’s partner in Alcarelle is David Orren, a mechanical engineer. “Don’t get me wrong — I’m a fan of alcohol, I enjoy good wine and single malts,” says Orren. But he’s sure technology can make them even better.

Indeed, consider all the ways technology has been used to enhance drugs or the delivery system — from e-cigarettes and water bongs to pharmaceuticals and synthetic analogues of hard drugs. Why not alcohol?

Nutt and Orren expect it could take up to four years for the product to cross all the regulatory hurdles that would see it approved for market. In the meantime it would be technically illegal in the U.K. (where drug laws became even tighter two years ago with the Psychoactive Substances Act) for them to give me a sample to try. So I have to take Orren’s word for what it feels like. Drinking a cocktail with Alcarelle’s chemical, he says, makes you feel like you’ve had “two glasses of wine. Warm — but clear. Refreshed. And it will not make you extra inebriated with more doses. Plus it gives you beautiful sleep, no hangover, no toxicity.”

Possibly too good to be true? 
 
Robert Dudley a professor of integrative biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of [*The Drunken Monkey: Why We Drink And Abuse Alcohol](https://www.amazon.com/Drunken-Monkey-Drink-Abuse-Alcohol/dp/0520275691?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=neodotlife-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=cc51741ca515f0ce23d1acdfb0bd8e4f&camp=1789&creative=9325)*, is skeptical that a synthetic molecule could be better for your liver than ethanol, which our bodies have had eons to adapt to. “My instinct is that we have an intrinsic drive to consume ethanol that can’t be replaced,” he says. “It’s our evolutionary heritage and we just have to deal with it.”

Sion Kim Harris, co-director of a substance-abuse research center at Boston Children’s Hospital, says she doubts that a new molecule could come without any risks. “Take e-cigarettes — the narrative at first was ‘here’s this great non-harmful alternative,’” she explains. “But what we are seeing is a rapid rise in young people starting their drug use with e-cigarettes, and then going on to other things and even smoking real cigarettes. If you put out the narrative that there is a healthy alternative, it takes down the inhibition, and those inhibitions are important because whenever we mess with our brain’s reward circuits, you are still activating that circuitry, and that can still lead to addiction.”
> # “My instinct is that we have an intrinsic drive to consume ethanol that can’t be replaced.”

It’s important to remember that there have been other circumstances when scientists tried to develop a less addictive and less harmful alternative and only made something more dangerous. Heroin was initially marketed and developed by Bayer in the 1800s as a non-addictive alternative to morphine. The mistake was repeated with oxycontin, which was sold by Purdue Pharma with the promise that it was not addictive. “We are deluding ourselves by saying there is somehow a free lunch when it comes to substances that target the reward circuitry of the brain,” Harris says.

Nutt and Orren are nonetheless optimistic. They plan to bring hangover-free booze to bars as soon as possible and to help liquor companies develop healthier alcoholic drinks. In January they plan new studies to investigate the biology of hangovers.

Even if on paper Alcarelle sounds perfect, Nutt and Orren acknowledge that the cultural barriers will be the biggest. Almost every corner of the earth has a local form of booze, from fine wines to single malt Scotch to craft beers and straight hard vodka, that is entwined into the region’s heritage. 
 
Moreover, it’s undeniable that some people take pride in being able to consume hideous amounts of alcohol — the inherent danger of drinking is part of the fun. In Australia they call it “pissed fitness.” Swinging London in the ’90s had the “ladette” culture — women drinking un-ladylike pints and proving they could outlast the boys. Or consider the booze binges in Russia known as “zapoi,” when Russians get blind drunk daily. The government has repeatedly tried to stamp out the tradition, and never succeeded.

Orren says he simply wants consumers to have more choice. But Nutt describes a bigger objective. He thinks old-fashioned alcohol will disappear within a generation. “We can’t avoid knowing about the harms of alcohol just because we like it,” he says.

# What Are Your Genes Telling You to Eat?

## What Are Your Genes Telling You to Eat?

### Companies are using your DNA to customize a diet plan. If it works, it might not be for the reasons advertised.

You’re in luck if your ideal diet plan involves a heaping helping of data. A new company called Habit will have you drink a special shake, prick your finger three times, and send the blood to a lab along with cheek swabs and detailed information about your body measurements and activity levels. A few weeks later you’ll receive dietary advice personalized to your genes and metabolism. To help you follow that advice, you can order ready-made meals.

Backed by $32 million in funding from Campbell Soup, Habit is part of a booming field of companies, with names like Orig3n and DayTwo, that promise a ultra-tailored nutritional experience. But it’s yet to be proven whether that tailoring matters.

Neil Grimmer, Habit’s founder and CEO, calls the company’s approach “test to table.” Habit’s analysis starts at $299 and looks at more than 60 biomarkers. From the cheek swabs, a lab analyzes your DNA for genetic variants that affect things like weight, metabolism, and caffeine sensitivity. The shake is similar to what you’d drink during a glucose tolerance test in a doctor’s office, but includes fat and protein too. By analyzing the blood you’ve drawn at three points in time after you’ve had the shake, Habit can study how you process those nutrients.

From the results, Habit assigns customers one of seven “habit types.” These are like personality types with a hunter-gatherer feel: “protein seekers” should embrace proteins like fish and limit carbohydrates; “plant seekers” can eat more carbs; “range seekers” have a lot of leeway. Customers also get coaching from a dietician and can get meals matched to them delivered to their door, [ready to be heated up](https://habit.com/our-meals). It costs $8.99 for breakfast and $13.50 for lunch or dinner such as lamb meatballs or a mango chicken noodle bowl. “They’re nutrient dense, but they’re also data rich,” Grimmer says of the foods.

![**Neil Grimmer and the Habit test kit.** (Courtesy of Habit)](1*lf_e5rZhFnmTZkyRqnwAEw.jpeg)***Neil Grimmer and the Habit test kit.** (Courtesy of Habit)*

Those who’d rather plan their own meals can follow a list of “food philosophies” for their diet type. Protein seekers, for instance, should keep vegetables on their plates and watch out for hidden fats and sugars — nothing too groundbreaking, in other words. “They’re all healthy recommendations,” says Erin Barrett, Habit’s head of scientific affairs. While every type’s food rules are widely applicable, she says, different people will have stricter or more flexible guidelines around certain food groups.

Habit launched in the Bay Area late last year and expanded to most of the country this summer. Grimmer acknowledges that the seven dietary categories are far from definitive. Habit could, he says, give “thousands of different personalized recommendations.” But by clustering these diets into the seven “habit types” Habit hopes to foster communities, he says. He thinks it will become an antidote to one-size-fits-all diet trends. “We kind of feel like we’re the fad-diet buster,” he says.

But personalized nutrition has become its own fad. Peter Jones, a professor at the University of Manitoba, estimates there are dozens of companies worldwide offering bespoke nutritional advice based on customers’ genes, microbiomes, or other factors. Scientists in the field are “getting in line to participate with these companies,” he says — himself included. Jones founded a company similar to Habit called [SNPitty](http://snpitty.com/), still in its early stages. (The simple genetic variations that these companies usually test for are called single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, pronounced “snips.”)

Habit is “ahead of the curve in a lot of ways,” Jones says, especially with its metabolic challenge shake. SNPitty won’t use a shake, but Jones wants to analyze more SNPs than Habit does and make dietary recommendations based on how hundreds of genes might work together.
> # “We kind of feel like we’re the fad-diet buster,” Grimmer says. But personalized nutrition has become its own fad.

No matter how many genes you analyze, they tell you only so much. That’s why the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics urged caution in a 2014 [position paper](http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(13)01783-8/fulltext) on nutritional genomics. Conditions such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes arise from many genetic and environmental factors working together, the authors wrote, so knowing about a single genetic variant isn’t all that useful. This field of science “holds promise,” the paper concluded, but “is not ready for routine dietetics practice.”

A 2015 [meta-analysis](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/omi.2015.0109) looked at the data behind 38 genes regularly included in private companies’ nutritional genomics tests. The authors found that data for most of these genetic variants either were inconsistent or hadn’t been reproduced. “As solid scientific evidence is currently lacking,” they wrote, “commercially available nutrigenomics tests cannot be presently recommended.”

Jones acknowledges that the field is in its early days. “We all have to be cautious about getting too enthusiastic with the data we have,” he says.

But even if personalized nutrition plans don’t work in the ways they claim to, they could still help people eat better. A 2017 [study](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/46/2/578/2622850/Effect-of-personalized-nutrition-on-health-related) randomly assigned 1,269 European adults to different diet plans. One group got advice based on their current diets; another got advice based on that information plus their body-mass index, waist circumference, and blood biomarkers; and a third set of recommendations were based on all those factors plus variations in five genes. A control group got generic diet advice. Six months later, subjects in all the personalized diet groups were eating more healthily than the control group. It didn’t matter which personalized group they’d been in — guidelines based on their starting diet were just as helpful as guidelines accounting for their physiology or genes.

So signing up for a diet based on your genes might help, and it probably won’t hurt. Except for the finger pricking.

# Checking in on the Quantified Self at 10

## They’ve been ahead of the curve on personal health tracking and citizen science. What will their doctors and the rest of us learn from their data addiction?

![**Gary Wolf** (Courtesy of Stanford Medicine X)](1*9qiJ5CYhxczYsk67Wf64gA.jpeg)***Gary Wolf** (Courtesy of Stanford Medicine X)*

I am so charmed by the Quantified Self community. In my second hometown of Amsterdam for their 10th anniversary conference last weekend, I expected to find people showing off their coding skills, or proving how much more disciplined they are than I. What I found instead was an incredibly warm and nurturing group of people who often had more questions than answers. They have a lot of information (and data!) to share, but they usually don’t consider themselves experts. If anything, they can be a bit self-deprecating about their obsession with measuring themselves, and don’t pretend to have answers for anyone but themselves and their fellow QSers. Amazingly, no one is trying to get you to use their dashboard.
 
If I’m not mistaken, not one person talked about what they do for a living or their degrees, even when they were computer scientists, or neuroscientists, or other people whose backgrounds might make you sit up and listen a little closer to their story about having five years worth of personal sleep, food, and activity data.

There are cautionary tales about accepting data at face value, such as the one told by Whitney Erin Boesel, a young woman whose doctors said her hormone levels were too low for her to conceive. Bouncing her beautiful and talkative baby on her hip months later, it was clear she didn’t give in to the data.
 
The QS community could be positioning itself as the vital center of the movement to document and discover ourselves and give our doctors data that could lead to breakthroughs. You might think QSers would have ambitious growth plans, and a PR outreach effort. Instead, they remain a relatively small group of 8,000 members, with relatively little media exposure. When they are recognized, it’s often a bit pejorative. A pharma CEO advised me to avoid talking about the QS community if I wanted to preserve credibility with “real scientists.”
 
On the occasion of its 10th gathering in Amsterdam last weekend, cofounder and leader Gary Wolf was musing about how the QS community was ahead of its time, before ubiquitous wearables and a growing citizen science movement. So how does QS stay ahead of the curve? More data, of course! Both Gary Wolf and Thomas Blomseth Christiansen, [a guy who recorded every single time he sneezed for five solid years](https://qz.com/507727/a-man-who-recorded-his-every-sneeze-for-five-years-might-have-a-fix-for-your-pollen-allergy/), could be harbingers of the next stage of the quantified self. Gary continuously monitored his blood sugar and found wild fluctuations in his glucose levels, meaning that a typical test done one day would have diagnosed him as perfectly healthy, and one on another day would have fallen outside the range of normal. Worse, it showed inexplicable spikes in the middle of the night. His next project is to see if continuous cholesterol monitoring will show similarly wide fluctuations. For Thomas, when his tracking devices gave him readings he couldn’t explain, he layered in more precise instruments to track the pace and number of steps in his runs.
 
Most consumer devices aren’t as accurate as they need to be. Doctors know that spot checks with more reliable medical-grade devices don’t necessarily lead to an accurate diagnosis — but those, along with physical observation, are all they have to go on, usually. And variability isn’t necessarily a symptom of disease or malfunction. Or is it? Maybe the QSers will help us find out.

Maybe I’m not obsessively tracking my own data because I’m not always as disciplined as I should be. QSers have a solution for that — apps to keep them on track and apps to deliver insights:

# A Peek Inside the Fridge of the Future

## Four big ideas about where food is heading.

![(Courtesy of The Future Market)](1*NwCXw0Uv9_nftw4NiQA8fA.jpeg)*(Courtesy of The Future Market)*

Aqua Cull fish sticks cost $6.99 a box. They have the same crunchy coating as ordinary fish sticks, but underneath is an invasive species such as lionfish. The actual fish inside depends on which species is wreaking ecological havoc in your region.

You can’t actually get Aqua Cull in the frozen food aisle yet — but Mike Lee thinks you’ll find something like it soon.


Lee founded [The Future Market](http://thefuturemarket.com/), a small group that comes up with [concept products](http://thefuturemarket.com/conceptproducts/) to predict what we’ll be eating five to 25 years in the future. Lee also co-founded [Alpha Food Labs](https://www.alphafoodlabs.com/), Future Market’s parent company, which consults with major food brands on product development. That consulting work, combined with insights from a sister company called [Food+Tech Connect](https://foodtechconnect.com/) that tracks food industry news and innovations, helps the Future Market team identify trends. Based on what they see, they create ambitious fantasy foods that they hope will [inspire the industry](https://newfoodeconomy.org/general-mills-signs-support-perennial-grain-kernza/).

Lee stresses that the concepts are grounded in the real world. “I don’t think there’s any product where we simply made something up and said, ‘Oh, in the future people are just going to be vaporizing their food and eating it,’” Lee says. “We don’t really do sci-fi stuff.” The imagined products reveal four main themes about the food of the future:

### **1. It will be all about experiences.**

Food will reflect the “flattening and shrinking of the world,” Lee says, with more opportunities to try foods that were once exotic. But there will also be a focus on regional flavors and terroir, the local environmental factors such as soil and sunshine that give some foods a distinctive flavor. Food will be more personalized, and it will have the ethos of the maker movement. A concept product called Digital Degustation lets users choose a fancy restaurant and download its menu items to their home 3-D food printer. A product called Nanobrew captures wild, airborne yeast from a person’s home to brew hyperlocal beer.

![**Three concepts from the Future Market: Wholly Cow, which includes several cuts of meat from the same “fully utilized” animal; Micro Green, a THC-infused olive oil spray for making food more relaxing; and Alga Marina, pasta made from farmed seaweed. **(Courtesy of The Future Market)](1*5Et7Sh6US6TzUIe_1wWb8w.jpeg)***Three concepts from the Future Market: Wholly Cow, which includes several cuts of meat from the same “fully utilized” animal; Micro Green, a THC-infused olive oil spray for making food more relaxing; and Alga Marina, pasta made from farmed seaweed. **(Courtesy of The Future Market)*

### **2. It will be tailored for your health.**

With the rise of the quantified-self movement and [precision nutrition](https://medium.com/neodotlife/habit-and-nutritional-genomics-60a45d476780), and awareness of how important our [microbiomes](https://medium.com/neodotlife/review-of-daytwo-microbiome-test-deacd5464cd5) may be to our health, Lee expects the food of the future to be customized and highly functional. A concept food called Precision Bar offers on-demand energy bars targeted to an individual’s energy needs and fitness goals. Custom Culture is yogurt made to work with a person’s microbiome.

### **3. It will be sustainable.**

Lee thinks food manufacturers will soon focus more on Earth-friendly practices like reducing food waste, preserving biodiversity, and making packaging that’s biodegradable. Concept products like Trim Snack and Offal Good make use of vegetable and meat scraps. Crop Crisps are crackers based on a different grain or legume each year in a four-year cycle, as source crops are rotated.

### **4. It will come from new kinds of farms.**

Food growers will embrace technologies like sensors, drones, vertical farming, and genetic engineering, Lee says. A concept product called Block Bird’s lets customers see their chicken’s entire supply chain, verified by blockchain.

Other farms will look less like cattle standing in a pen, and more like microbes stewing in a vat. So-called [cellular agriculture startups](https://medium.com/neodotlife/corby-kummer-on-finless-foods-80fdfec10e14) are already engineering yeast and bacteria to make animal products like dairy protein or [lab-grown meat](https://medium.com/neodotlife/wild-earth-lab-grown-pet-food-bb8a19dfaf5a). Heritage Culture is a concept product that uses cellular agriculture to recreate “luxury proteins” like Wagyu beef. The technology could also recreate foods that Lee calls “delicious yet taboo,” like shark-fin soup, which is illegal in several states because of its reliance on unsustainable and cruel fishing practices. The Future Market imagines a cultured version called Faux Fin.

Lee thinks these foods are among the furthest away, but they’re also the dishes he looks forward to most. “I really am excited to sit down in the near future and dig into a full steak that was cell ag,” he says.

# Round Trips to the Pearly Gates

## With better CPR techniques, more people might live to tell the tale of what happens right before everything slips away.

![Illustration by Gwendal Le Bec](1*pWjQJProIY7NwPPhwmGVYw.jpeg)*Illustration by Gwendal Le Bec*

What is it like to die?

Some people who have been revived say they saw a light at the end of a tunnel. Some report sights of demons with pitchforks or a featureless void that goes on forever in time and space. Others describe leaving their body and watching doctors work on them. “Your consciousness, part of what makes you who you are, does not get annihilated when you go through death,” says Sam Parnia, who has studied near-death experiences. “It remains, but we’re not sure for how long.”

However, Parnia might soon uncover new clues about what happens in the brain as life ebbs. He and colleagues are developing techniques that could significantly improve the success rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, better known as CPR.


Cardiac arrest was almost always fatal until CPR was introduced in the 1960s. Chest compressions, often combined with artificial ventilation, could be used to help restore blood flow, and hence oxygen, to the brain and other organs. The technique, which can be performed both by doctors and laypeople, would buy time before a defibrillator was available to give the heart an electric shock and restore its natural rhythm. Suddenly, resuscitation became a possibility, with success cases reported all over the world.

Nonetheless, the odds of being revived are still low. There are about [350,000 resuscitation attempts](http://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/General/UCM_477263_Cardiac-Arrest-Statistics.jsp) outside hospitals in the U.S. every year, but about 12 percent of people survive. Almost 40 percent of cardiac arrests happen in a hospital, but even there around one in four people survive. CPR is “not very effective,” says Parnia, a [leading resuscitation researcher](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1467610337/sam-parnia) at New York University Langone Medical Center.

He and his colleagues are trying to make the biggest improvements in CPR since it was conceived over 50 years ago. They’re focusing on how to keep the brain intact.

Rebooting a person’s heart is only part of the CPR puzzle. By the time the heart begins to beat again, the brain might have been deprived of too much oxygen for too long. A person could come back to life with brain damage or in a vegetative state. But Parnia and his colleagues have now figured out how much oxygen needs to be maintained in the brain to lessen the chance of those problems.
> # “There is a high divorce rate among people who have had a near-death experience.”

They have also found a way [to monitor those oxygen levels](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Abstract/2014/04000/A_Feasibility_Study_of_Cerebral_Oximetry_During.20.aspx) in real time during CPR using a non-invasive technique that shines infrared light into a patient’s brain. In [a recent study](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Abstract/publishahead/Monitoring_the_Relationship_Between_Changes_in.96345.aspx), they showed that it can be combined with EEG, a way of measuring brainwaves by placing electrodes on the scalp, to reveal the corresponding brain activity and gain insight into how the brain is functioning.

Their next step is to figure out how to deliver more oxygen to the brain during CPR. For the cases that occur in hospitals, existing technologies that aren’t widely used could be part of the solution. For example, there’s extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, a procedure used for life support. It involves pumping blood out of a cardiac arrest patient and into a machine where it is oxygenated and recirculated into the body. Another possible alternative is to increase use of mechanical CPR. That’s when doctors strap a device onto a patient to provide more consistent and uninterrupted chest compressions. “Both have been shown to increase oxygen delivery to the brain,” says Parnia.

### **Spiritual guides**

If the researchers are successful, surviving a cardiac arrest will become much more common. And the more people we resurrect, the better we will understand the process of death.

Because of the spooky nature of near-death experiences, for instance, it’s often suggested that something paranormal is going on as life ends. People recount floating above their bodies and watching their own resuscitation, hinting that we possess a soul that separates from our physical self. Experiments have attempted to verify these claims by placing hidden targets in hospital rooms that are only visible from above. However so far nobody has reported seeing them during an out-of-body experience.

[Christopher French](https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/french/), a psychologist from Goldsmiths, University of London who studies paranormal experiences, thinks that conventional neuroscience will be able to explain near-death accounts. Fighter pilots have reported similar visions when they have lost consciousness during extreme acceleration, which also causes reduced blood flow and hence oxygen to the brain. And some people are able to have out-of-body experiences at will. Evidence from these cases suggests that it’s a type of hallucination that occurs when sensory inputs such as proprioception, vision, and hearing aren’t properly perceived by the brain. But further research is needed to thoroughly explain near-death experiences. “It’s a hard topic to study due to ethical constraints,” says French. “Technological developments will probably allow us to get a greater insight.”
> # Having more resurrected flatliners among us could prompt more people to reevaluate what’s important in life.

A greater familiarity with near-death experiences may also help to support those who have survived them. Especially in Western cultures, people can find it hard to talk about what they have seen because there is still no accepted scientific rationale and they fear seeming crazy. This can make it hard for them to connect with people they used to be close to. “There is a high divorce rate among people who have had a near-death experience,” says French.

Feeling alienated may be less of an issue in a world where more people are resuscitated and report similar accounts. “People might feel safer talking about them,” says [Natasha Tassell-Matamua](http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/expertise/profile.cfm?stref=830930), a psychology researcher at Massey University in New Zealand. At the moment, she thinks, there are a lot of unreported cases.

All in all, near-death experiences are positive for most people. They interpret what they’ve seen as glimpses of an afterlife. It tends to make them less scared of dying, more caring, and more spiritual. “It’s a long-lasting effect,” French says.

Perhaps they can influence the rest of us as well. Tassell-Matamua found that when people were taught about near-death experiences and their aftereffects, they [reaped some of the same benefits](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19349637.2016.1206844) as survivors, such as a better appreciation of life, death, and spirituality. “It’s all too easy on a day-to-day basis to be engrossed in a to-do list of trivial jobs,” says French, who thinks that having more resurrected flatliners among us could prompt more people to reevaluate what’s important in life.

# What to Do While Waiting for Neural Lace

## Step one: breathe …

![Illustration by Kelsey Wroten](1*ThfiBuMo2-q7Hu4TZar1hw.gif)*Illustration by Kelsey Wroten*

I f you want to upgrade your brain, [it’s too bad that you’ll probably be old](https://medium.com/neodotlife/brain-machine-abc53a3b27ca) before neural lace or a similar brain-machine mind meld is widely available. You ought to take up meditation instead.

It’s not surprising that any relaxation technique [has a wide range of health benefits](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm). But meditation is also a form of exercise — it requires mental effort. And over time this activity appears to rewire the brain in ways that stave off and possibly [reverse the decay typically associated with aging](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00076/full).

[Sara Lazar](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sara_lazar/home), a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital who is a leading researcher on the effects of meditation, [has seen the changes](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sara_lazar/our-research) in imaging studies. Experienced meditators have more gray matter in the portions of the brain devoted to sensory processing, working memory, and decision-making — parts that usually shrink with age.

Lazar and other researchers are now going deeper. They’re studying how various forms of mindfulness — such as tai chi and yoga — affect the brain differently. It eventually might be possible to determine which meditative techniques are optimal for people suffering from a specific problem, just like certain forms of physical exercise are good after a particular injury.

Such insights are beginning to take shape in studies like [one published last summer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12671-016-0594-9) in the journal *Mindfulness* by Bethany Kok and Tania Singer of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences Institute in Leipzig, Germany. For that study, the researchers followed 229 people who were taught different practices — breathing meditation, body scan meditation, loving-kindness meditation, and observing-thought meditation — and compared the effects on their health and behavior to each other and to control groups.

The results were not necessarily surprising — for example, body scan, a practice of focusing on sensations in the body, was best at increasing awareness of physiological stimuli and decreasing “thought content.” Nonetheless, Kok and Singer wrote, the study helped establish that “meditation is not about engaging in indiscriminate mental effort; each practice appears to create a distinct mental environment, the long-term consequences of which are only beginning to be explored.” Singer says that as many as 30 more papers are planned on other meditation research from the Planck Institute’s [ReSource Project](https://www.resource-project.org/en/home.html), which she calls the largest effort of its kind.

Early studies of meditation showed that it could help relieve depression, anxiety disorders, pain, and insomnia, but didn’t quite establish whether such improvements came about because of the meditation or because of other things study subjects were also doing. But more recent research, Lazar says, “showed as well that it wasn’t because of a change in environment — it was a change in how they reacted to the environment.” Knowing that there is a physical basis in the brain for these improvements means that meditation could be useful in addressing disorders that manifest themselves in the same parts of the cortex, including Alzheimer’s and PTSD.

Lazar points out that the benefits of these mental workouts accrue even if you meditate for five to 10 minutes a day, though more is better — up to a point. “More than 40 minutes per day can be detrimental,” Lazar says, “just as over-exercising can be detrimental.”

She also believes that while meditation apps such as Headspace and guided meditation recordings are helpful, they’re probably not good enough on their own to bring about the kind of brain rewiring she has seen in experienced meditators — people whose cortexes at age 50 looked like those of non-meditators at age 25. Meditation is such an intensely personal experience, she says, that invariably practitioners have questions that only a teacher can resolve.

If so, should health insurance cover the cost of meditation classes and retreats, much as some plans today help cover gym memberships? “The data is not quite there yet,” Lazar says. “But maybe, someday, it will be.”

# Designer Babies Are Here. What’s the Next Edit?

## Designer Babies Are Here. What’s the Next Edit?

### A Chinese scientist engineered kids to resist HIV. Here are other changes that could be on the feature list for Humanity 2.0.

He Jiankui stunned the world this week when a [report](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612458/exclusive-chinese-scientists-are-creating-crispr-babies/) revealed he had edited genes in human embryos aiming to make people resistant to HIV infection. So far, two children, twin girls named Lulu and Nana, are said to have been born with altered genomes.


The Chinese scientist’s work crossed a line that many have feared and some have dreamed of: the creation of designer babies engineered for certain enhancements.

Editing genes in embryos is hugely controversial because the changes can be passed along to future generations. You can imagine, for instance, using gene editing to wipe out a genetic disease in an entire family tree. This is what makes altering DNA in sperm, eggs, or embryos — known as germline editing — so powerful. But if something were to go wrong, like cutting an unintended place in the genome, the resulting child could have health problems or introduce new, potentially harmful mutations into the gene pool, where they could be difficult to eradicate. That risk has made the scientific community wary of using gene editing in this way.
> # The floodgates are open, and further efforts to edit DNA in germline cells are already being discussed.

But He didn’t edit embryos afflicted with a disease-causing gene. Instead, he edited healthy embryos with the aim of imparting a genetic advantage: resistance to HIV. His experiment involved using the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to disable a gene called *CCR5*. A subset of Europeans have a mutation in this gene that makes them resistant to HIV.

### Crossing the line

The scientific community has widely condemned He’s work. After all, safe and effective ways to prevent and treat HIV already exist. Moreover, there’s evidence that knocking out *CCR5* could increase susceptibility to [West Nile virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16418398) and [aneurysms in the aorta](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16418398).

But the floodgates are open, and further efforts to edit DNA in germline cells are already being discussed. Beyond preventing diseases, enhancing the human genome suddenly is on the table.

Speaking at the Second International Genome Editing Summit in Hong Kong on Nov. 28, Harvard Medical School Dean George Daley made the case for ethical uses of germline editing. Daley said He’s recklessness should not derail other scientists.

![He Jiankui, who claims to have created designer babies, presenting his work at the Human Genome Editing Conference in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Nov. 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)](1*jjhhNxKcGUXAAa0A7eI4sg.jpeg)*He Jiankui, who claims to have created designer babies, presenting his work at the Human Genome Editing Conference in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Nov. 28, 2018. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)*

“Just because the first steps were missteps doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t step back, restart, and think about a plausible and responsible path for clinical translation,” Daley said.

### Potential upgrades

Geneticists studying human DNA tend to focus on harmful mutations, but some appear to have beneficial effects.

“There are plenty of people walking around with apparent normal function who are lacking *CCR5*,” says David Nelson, president of the American Society of Human Genetics and professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor College of Medicine.

It’s possible that recreating other helpful genetic mutations could effectively upgrade the human genome, yielding healthier individuals and eventually, whole populations.

One is *PCSK9*. Scientists have been interested in this gene as a drug target because some people with mutations have low cholesterol. The idea is, if a drug were to interfere with *PCSK9* and reduce the amount of protein it makes, it would cut cholesterol. Mimicking the naturally-occurring *PCSK9* mutation before birth using CRISPR hypothetically could protect individuals from high cholesterol throughout their lives, reducing the risk of heart disease.

![](1*kPcYgzY228hYFdDTRUs23Q.png)

Another beneficial genetic variant that might be copied with genome editing occurs in the *APP* gene. This gene carries instructions to make amyloid, the protein that builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. A mutation found in Icelandic and Scandinavian populations [protects against Alzheimer’s](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11283). This variant, *A673T*, is rare: Only about 0.5 percent of Icelanders and 0.2 to 0.5 percent of Finns, Swedes, and Norwegians have it. Editing it into the germline could potentially cut the risk of Alzheimer’s among a broader population.

People with a mutation in the *FUT2* gene are much [less likely to get norovirus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4845991/), a highly contagious virus that’s notorious for causing bouts of vomiting and diarrhea on holiday cruises. About 30 percent of people of European ancestry and 20 percent of those of African ancestry carry this variant. The mutation doesn’t appear to be completely protective, and norovirus isn’t life-threatening. Would humanity be better off with fewer cases of the cruise-ship virus?

### Features or bugs?

Other mutations are known to bestow health benefits but also bring their own problems. For example, mutations in the *NPC1* gene confer resistance to Ebola but cause a subtype of Niemann-Pick disease, a serious metabolic disorder. And mutations in the *G6PD* gene seem to protect against malaria but also cause anemia. So, while these genetic variants might have nominal benefits, the side effects — in some cases, lifelong diseases — almost certainly outweigh the potential advantages.

“Even if you think you’re making a very simple mutation, there could be effects that we didn’t intend,” Nelson says.

He Jiankui is the first to set foot in this messy landscape. It’s not yet clear that his experiment worked well — or at all. The protective mutation in the *CCR5* gene involves a change in 32 base pairs of DNA, and whether He created that exact mutation is unknown. It’s not certain that either of the engineered twins is actually HIV-resistant, and one reportedly carries both altered and unaltered cells, a condition known as mosaicism.

A larger question is whether germline editing of certain genes can improve on natural selection. Time spans measured in thousands of years may be necessary to fully evaluate the tradeoffs.

# Evolution’s Secret Ingredient

## “The Rise of Yeast” explains how one fungus altered history.

![**Bread bakers depicted on a 13th-century parchment.** (Courtesy of J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles)](1*X1REy_ad5DB0YtykKruc5g.jpeg)***Bread bakers depicted on a 13th-century parchment.** (Courtesy of J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles)*

W e exist in a sea of living things, inside us and all around us. There may be a trillion species of microbes on Earth — floating in clouds and helping to make rain and snow, living in superheated hot springs and vents, and thriving two miles underground.

Nicholas Money, a professor of microbiology at Miami University, Ohio, has written several books ranging over this vast microbial world with its odd and amazing characters. His latest, [*The Rise of Yeast](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Yeast-Fungus-Shaped-Civilization/dp/0190270713?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=neodotlife-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=6587b1c0336b2af911c7395eab519d48&camp=1789&creative=9325), *chronicles our cultural, culinary, and biological symbioses with just one of them: baker’s/brewer’s yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae, *and how it has shaped history.

Many organisms could leaven bread as yeast does: by converting sugar to carbon dioxide. But *Saccharomyces *also makes alcohol in the process, which keeps competing microbes away. The alcohol kept the yeast starters in bakeries pure enough to provide leavening for generations.


*Saccharomyces* first hitched its way to our tables in early wines. With an alcohol content high enough to prevent spoilage, wine became a good that could form trading routes, inspire pantheons, shape cultures and maybe, [help establish human intelligence](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/ability-consume-alcohol-may-have-shaped-primate-evolution). Today, yeast continues to move human affairs. It’s a cornerstone of our global food system and offers a window into the mechanisms of life.

Our co-evolution with bread and beer is a particularly engaging story in Money’s book. Through most of history, eating leavened bread was an unpredictable experience. Sometimes it was bitter, sometimes it was sweet, depending on the varying quality of the leavening starters that bakers used and handed down.

Variations in the taste of bread might be tolerable, but nobody wants to pay for skunky beer. So brewers got more rigorous. They learned to keep track of the specific yeasts that produced the tastiest beers. In so doing, these brewers—including Carlsberg, a company that still exists today—laid the foundations for modern microbiology. They isolated and tested specific strains of yeast and created a legion of distinct flavors and brands in the process. Bakers who used yeast from brewers’ vats figured out how to make [a perfect sweet roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_bread) in the late 1800s simply by replacing their usual starter with a pure microbial preparation of *Saccharomyces*.

![](1*go1Csi1eS7KZcVx9fK9QpQ.jpeg)

Within 40 years, yeast cake factories had set up across Europe and in the U.S., and baking became consistent. That’s why bakeries can churn out products that taste the same in Bangkok, London, or Ohio, and why there are envelopes of yeast sitting in refrigerator doors around the world.

Biologist E.O. Wilson memorably predicted in *Sociobiology* and *Consilience* that biology would enable us to see ourselves more clearly as a culture as well as a species. The *Rise of Yeast* delivers on that because it’s not so much about yeast as it is about us, and how we have co-evolved with a microorganism. Microbes are much more than sources of disease, devastatation, and decomposition: the microbial sea helps form our culture. Harnessing *Saccharomyces cerevesiae* was just the beginning. In the new cellular agriculture movement, microbes will become the whole basis for food, and humans and microorganisms will evolve together again.

# How Much Are Your Body Parts Worth?

## How Much Are Your Body Parts Worth?

### We’re only talking legal sales here.

Nick Colas is a Wall Street analyst who looks for market indicators in the Google auto-fill results for “I want to sell …” and “I want to buy ...” A few years ago, he noticed a search term showing up more and more frequently: “I want to sell my eggs.”

“These were not poultry farmers,” Colas says. At the same time, he started noticing ads on the train between New York City and New Jersey, enticing women to sell their eggs. The country was in the midst of the Great Recession, and a lot of people were desperate to make money. Eggs weren't the only biological material suddenly trending in his Google data—queries from people wanting to sell their hair and even kidneys were also increasingly popular. (You can’t legally sell your kidneys, but black-market profiteers in some countries coerce poor people into doing it for [just a few hundred bucks](http://www.atimes.com/article/pakistan-denial-scale-illegal-organ-harvesting/).)

Trade in bodily material usually booms during downturns in more traditional markets. But even during times of economic prosperity it maintains a brisk pace online. Monetizing one's own body yields an income of last resort that, thanks to the Internet, is now easier than ever, through what Colas calls the “biological version of the sharing economy.”

As genetic data and stem cells become more sought-after, new revenue streams are opening up all the time: DNA samples [could now earn you $50](https://medium.com/neodotlife/dna-wants-to-be-free-d2dd205667f9) or more, and certain kinds of stem cells could net up to $800 per donation. But why only some kinds? Because this is a confused market. Companies and medical professionals assume that laws such as the 1984 National Organ Transplant Act, which banned payment for organ donors, apply to fetal tissue and the stem cells derived from it, but not to stem cells obtained from blood.

Even with some legal limits, the priceless temple of your body is also a reserve of salable material. As Colas says, “the next recession is always just around the corner.” So here's an updated inventory, based on a wide range of sources.

# What Will It Take to 3-D Print Organs?

## Eventually, no one will die while waiting for a transplant. But that day is further off than you might think.

![**The kidneys (left) and a tubule made by bioprinting (right), the subject of a paper that Jennifer Lewis and other researchers published last fall.** (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock; [Scientific Reports](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5057112/figure/f1/))](1*BeMQOSY7CYqBDP6_BFm5cw.jpeg)***The kidneys (left) and a tubule made by bioprinting (right), the subject of a paper that Jennifer Lewis and other researchers published last fall.** (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock; [Scientific Reports](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5057112/figure/f1/))*

Every day in the U.S., about 22 people die waiting for an organ transplant. If scientists could 3-D print organs like kidneys, livers and hearts, all those lives could be saved. For years, people have been [touting](https://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_printing_a_human_kidney) personalized organ printing as the future.

But despite decades of [promising work in bioengineered bladders](http://www.wakehealth.edu/News-Releases/2006/Wake_Forest_Physician_Reports_First_Human_Recipients_of_Laboratory-Grown_Organs.htm) and [other kinds of human tissue](http://www.nature.com/news/tissue-engineering-how-to-build-a-heart-1.13327), we’re not close to having more complicated organs made from scratch. Harvard professor Jennifer Lewis, a leader in advanced 3-D printing of biological tissue, [has only recently developed ](http://harvardmagazine.com/2017/01/building-toward-a-kidney)the ability to print part of a nephron, an individual unit of a kidney. And the segment her team can print is able to do only some of what this nephron subunit is supposed to do.

I asked Lewis what it will take to someday print a full kidney or a similarly complex organ. Current research uses either 3-D printing (also called bioprinting) like Lewis’s lab does, or what’s known as de-cell re-cell. That’s when scientists [take an organ](http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v14/n2/abs/nm1684.html) from an animal like a pig or from a human cadaver and remove all of the cells from it by applying chemicals or enzymes or freezing the organ. This leaves behind only proteins that provide a scaffolding structure on which human cells can be grown.

Lewis says that with either approach, there are three fundamental challenges to overcome, each harder than the last:

**1. Physical complexity**

“Kidney, liver, heart — these are just incredibly complex microstructures,” Lewis says. The kidney alone has over 20 different cell types and a million nephrons, each made of many parts and wrapped in an intricate web of tiny blood vessels. “And it’s all packed in a pretty small volume,” says Lewis. “That architectural complexity alone, that’s a challenge in and of itself for the printing process.”

**Timeline to achieve:**

“With bioprinting alone, it’s going to take many years,” says Lewis. However, combining the approaches of bioprinting and growing mini-organs, known as organoids, from stem cells “could rapidly accelerate that.” Essentially, you would use 3-D printing to give an organ its architecture, and grow organoids on that organizing structure. “There’s potential there within the next decade, perhaps even sooner,” she says.

**2. Function**
 As hard as it is to build something resembling an organ, it’s even harder — and more vital — to build one that does exactly what it’s supposed to.

The kidney does two crucial things: first it filters everything out of your blood, good and bad, and then it puts the important stuff back in, leaving the toxins out so the body can get rid of them. Lewis’s lab has so far tackled the second of these functions. Last fall, [her group was the first to 3-D print a working proximal tubule](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5057112/), one of the parts of an individual nephron that returns good stuff to the blood.

“But the proximal tubule is one subunit within a nephron that itself has multiple subunits, and then of course there’s a million of those in the kidney,” says Lewis. “While I’m super excited about that advance, it’s really a tiny step towards the entire problem.” Her lab still hasn’t tackled the other half of kidney function, the filtration.

**Timeline to achieve:**

Once her group can make one working nephron, then it would have to reliably produce a million of them and ensure that they function together. To do that and transplant it into a human? “I think it’s somewhere between 10 and 30-plus years, to be honest,” she says.

**3. Rejection**

Building an organ that the patient’s body won’t reject may be the steepest challenge of all. Most organ-printing researchers, including Lewis, use generic cells from biomedical supply companies. “It’s still not clear whether the body will treat that as from itself,” she says.

The odds could improve if you build an organ with stem cells harvested from a specific patient. But research on that technique is far off. Using repositories of stem cells from particular patients is more expensive. And it lacks one of the major benefits of using standard commercial cell lines, which is that research data is more comparable across different labs. There’s little point in using patient-specific stem cells if researchers can’t yet make a functioning organ with them. And once they can, there probably would be years of clinical trials.

**Timeline to achieve:**

“I still think the rejection piece is going to be the hardest to solve,” Lewis says. But she adds: “I think it is possible.”

# Skinny Genes

## Anorexia may originate in your gut and your DNA, not in fashion magazines.

By [Christina Farr](http://www.cnbc.com/christina-farr/)

![Illustration by Nick Vokey](1*_kQ1sr3KMUWxOjADVbgQNg.jpeg)*Illustration by Nick Vokey*

Ifirst met Kristina Saffran, a blonde and elegant Harvard graduate in a full-length ball gown at a swanky benefit in San Francisco. Moments later, she addressed a crowd of Silicon Valley tycoons about the gaps in funding for eating disorder treatment. By the end of the evening, after Saffran invited a group of young men and women to share their struggles with the disease, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house. 
 
Saffran and I reconnected a month later at an old Italian coffee shop in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. She ordered a green tea and began telling me about her personal struggle with anorexia nervosa. “I weighed 75 pounds at 14,” she told me — a dangerously low weight for her age. After making a full recovery, her mission now is to change misconceptions about the disease. “It’s seen as a white girl vanity issue,” she continued. “It’s the most under-funded, stigmatized disease.”

These days, the scientific community is increasingly on her side. With new tools like DNA sequencing at their disposal, researchers are finding that the disease is not psychological — or the fault of the fashion industry for promoting unhealthy body image. [In fact, many now believe](http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/08039488.2015.1074284) that such stereotypes have held back important, evidence-based research, as well as potential new treatments. That’s a big problem, given that anorexia affects millions of people and is ranked as the most fatal mental disorder, with a mortality rate of 10 percent.

One of Saffran’s strongest academic allies is Cynthia Bulik, a former dancer turned academic who thinks that the old stereotypes that blame media and a woman’s psychology are inhibiting understanding and treatment. “We have been trying to present the new science without the baggage of the inaccurate history,” says Bulik, a clinical psychiatrist and the founding director of the University of North Carolina Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders.
> # Researchers are finding that the disease is not psychological — or the fault of the fashion industry for promoting unhealthy body image.

Bulik has long been fascinated with the question of why so many people with eating disorders report feeling calm and in control after restricting calories. She has seen it firsthand with her own patients, as well as in her previous career as a professional figure skater. “Most of us don’t like being in a negative energy balance, where we’re eating less than we’re expending,” she explains. “But many of those who are prone to anorexia are anxious at baseline, and then the negative energy seems to balance them.”

In Saffran’s case, restricting calories alleviated her anxiety, prompting her to research how her brain functions differently from her peers’. She is particularly optimistic about the potential of genetics to unlock pervasive mysteries about the disease. “I want to understand why some people’s bodies are more predisposed to punishment than reward.”

Some people can tolerate restricting calories far better than others, which scientists are still working to understand. Bulik is now working with an international cohort of researchers to better understand the genetic components of anorexia. It’s now widely understood that genetics, environmental factors and personality traits (one common one, according to Bulik, is “perfectionism”) combine to increase a person’s liability for an eating disorder.

Genes seem to play a larger role that many scientists had anticipated. [A recent crop of family and twin studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3599773/) suggest that eating disorders aggregate in families, with heritability estimates of 48 percent to 74 percent. To dive deeper, researchers from the United States, Sweden, Australia and Denmark [kicked off the largest-ever genetic investigation in 2014](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/25/088815) with funding from the Klarman Family Foundation. The scientists collected clinical information and blood samples from 13,000 people who had anorexia nervosa at some point in their lives, and compared them to a control group.

The process involved extracting and analyzing each person’s DNA to identify the specific genes that influence anorexia. Researchers looked for genetic variations that were more frequent in people with anorexia compared to those who were never diagnosed with the disease. “We are not expecting one gene,” says Bulik. “Instead, hundreds of genes of relatively small effect seem to combine in different ways among those with anorexia.” The final research paper is still under peer review, but Bulik expects the results to be published in 2017 or 2018.

One early finding from the research particularly struck Bulik: that people with anorexia have a naturally low body mass index (BMI) and even when doctors help them gain back a normal weight in the hospital, they still very quickly bounce back to their low BMI. “For some people, the low BMI seems to be what the body is gravitating to,” she says. “We don’t really understand the biology of this yet.”

![](1*QjOFOT-wTOp2lZyoh46poA.png)

Bulik is hoping that the scientific community will eventually come up with a risk score for developing an eating disorder, which takes into account both genetic and environmental factors. Another outcome could be new therapies that target the biological pathways that underlie the illness. Such targeted treatments don’t currently exist, but eventually they could prove to be helpful in preventing the onset of the disease and not just treating it.

Perhaps, she says, researchers will find a way to convince the body that a negative energy balance is not a desirable outcome. Finally, she suggests that this kind of research might be useful in more accurately diagnosing anorexia, as well as in preventing it among those who are at risk.

Genetics isn’t the only promising area of research. University of North Carolina microbiologist Ian Carroll heard about Bulik’s work and saw some unexpected parallels with his own. Carroll studies the complex community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live harmoniously in our intestines. In some diseases, this microbial balance gets thrown off.

Carroll is particularly fascinated by so-called “gnotobiotic” animals, which are raised in sterile conditions that allow scientists to control their microbial environment. With far less diversity of microbes, these animals will experience symptoms like an underactive immune system and an ability to eat more without putting on weight.

After a meeting with Bulik, Carroll and his graduate students wondered what they’d discover by examining the gut microbiomes of people with anorexia before and after they’ve been re-fed in a clinical setting.

After analyzing fecal samples, his team found that people with anorexia appear to have a lower diversity of microbes both before and after re-feeding. That diversity had started to increase after the patients were taking in far more calories, but not significantly. They also found a correlation between anxiety and depression and low diversity of microbes in the gut.
> # Anorexia is ranked as the most fatal mental disorder, with a mortality rate of 10 percent.

One potential explanation for this is that in an environment where the body is being deprived of nutrients, some microbes will thrive and others will die off. Some of the microbes that survive could have evolved in a way that leads them to produce chemicals that function as neurotransmitters and give the individual a sense of wellbeing when they restrict calories, suggests Carroll. This is still unproven, but Carroll is hoping to secure more research grants for clinical studies in the coming years.

His goals for the research are to help people with anorexia gain weight in a safe and effective manner and to help doctors predict those who will recover more quickly. He also wants to help improve patients’ overall behavioral health. To these ends, he’s working with John F. Cryan at Ireland’s University College Cork Microbiome Institute to conduct experiments in mice with a similar microbiome. “This is cutting-edge stuff,” he says. “But bear in mind that it is the kind of research that gets a good bit of criticism, as there are microbes that love to survive in humans that don’t live in mice.”

Bulik agrees with this sentiment, but is hoping that the results will help win over other microbiologists in the field. “The microbiome research is such a new way of looking at this illness,” she adds.

Many researchers see major potential in so-called fecal transplants to address imbalances in the microbiome. The somewhat icky procedure is exactly what you might expect: it involves putting poop from one patient into another’s colon. Thus far, it has proven to be an effective treatment for an illness caused by a bacterium called *Clostridium difficile*, or C. diff. Carroll believes the next candidate for fecal transplants could be a patient with anorexia, to see whether re-establishing a diversity of microbes makes a difference. Carroll is collaborating with a company that he declined to name on a potential clinical trial.

Saffran sees huge potential in this collaborative research, and is even considering a career in academia. She believes that the findings from Bulik and Carroll’s research, as well as a handful of others, will help advocates build a case for much-needed funding for basic research and treatment. “The research has meant that we’re seeing far less stigma,” she says. “It’s a tiny field, but the disease is finally rising to national prominence.”

# 23-Year-Old VC Bets on Lengthening Health Span

## MIT dropout Laura Deming is on the hunt for causes of disease and mechanisms for quashing it.

![Illustration by Meryl Rowin](1*7KkhljUfRXE_Jk5-i51-LQ.gif)*Illustration by Meryl Rowin*

Aging is a problem that Silicon Valley believes it can solve. But before Google launched Calico, its [$1.5 billion venture](http://www.fiercebiotech.com/partnering/updated-abbvie-partners-google-s-calico-on-1-5b-r-d-operation-focused-on-aging) to cheat death, and Craig Venter and Peter Diamandis teamed to form [Human Longevity](http://www.humanlongevity.com/) Inc., there was 17-year-old Laura Deming.

In 2012, she dropped out of MIT on a [Thiel Fellowship](http://thielfellowship.org/), moved to California, and began raising $4 million for her first venture capital fund, inspired by her work with a mentor, Cynthia Kenyon, who studies life extension and aging.

Though Deming’s [Longevity Fund](https://longevity.vc/) has a lot less money to invest than other VC firms, her portfolio now includes high-profile companies such as [Unity Biotechnology](http://unitybiotechnology.com/), which has raised $151 million to develop therapies that clear the body of “senescent” cells linked to diseases of aging, and [Precision BioSciences](http://precisionbiosciences.com/), which is using genome editing to harness a patient’s immune system to develop new cancer therapies.

Last week, Deming, now 23, announced her second fund, totaling $22 million. She plans to invest in eight to 10 early-stage companies focused on increasing human “health span” — the years we live relatively free of disease. I called her for more details.

**Congrats on the fund. What are the most exciting areas of health span R&D to you right now?**

That is always the hardest question to answer. It’s really not so much the area as it is the area plus the opportunity — if we see an incredible entrepreneur come up. In one day, maybe I’ll look at two to five companies. They will all have different stories. Some will say, “Oh, we are going after a specific gene,” and some will have some kind of platform technology. Sometimes I meet someone who changes my mind about something or tells me about a fascinating new area of science that I hadn’t known about before. It’s unlike tech investing, where one could say, “I’m really interested in VR.” If we were to say that “we are interested in these five genetic pathways,” that would be a little too specific.

**When has an entrepreneur changed your mind?**

Probably every day entrepreneurs are convincing me that biology is predictable in some way. My biggest bias is that humans are too complex to predict things well, and most of our observations won’t translate or generalize.

**Rates of diseases like Alzheimer’s and certain cancers are rising as people live longer. What diseases do you think offer the biggest opportunity to tackle now?**

What makes us as a fund different from others is that when you say “disease,” I am confused by what the term really means at its core. A lot of what we call a disease could be something like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where literally in the title of the disease, we don’t know what causes this. It’s a set of symptoms. Our fund is all about causes and mechanisms.

**Can you give an example?**

A good example has been [immunotherapy](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/immunotherapy.html). It has been more of a mechanism than going after a disease, but that has given this huge boom to the field of oncology in the last couple of years. We’re interested in things that mirror that, where you have a mechanism that is driving the excitement, and you can find ways to apply the concept in a really powerful way.
> # “If an investment area is long-term then youth is an advantage.”

**How do you look at company’s technological approach to aging therapies? There’s a lot of promise and hype in areas like gene editing or stem cell therapy.**

If you could snap your fingers and immediately edit all the genes in the human body, that would be great. But what often gets confused is that [the editing] may be part of a technology stack.

With [RNAi](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/rnai/rna-interference-overview.html), for example, many people thought that was going to be the next big thing. You can have this incredible research tool, but it only solves part of the problem. The thing we are trying to understand better is between having a really exciting pre-clinical result and having a really efficacious therapy in humans: what is the full stack of technologies needed for that? Twenty years down the line, the things that prevented RNAi from taking off may [have been developed], so maybe it is an exciting time to go back and try and invest.

**What is it like to be a very young VC?**

By definition, if an investment area is long-term then youth is an advantage. Time is squarely on your side to ask questions over decades. The negatives are too multiple to count, of course. If something is very hard by definition, even to think about theoretically, starting off with no social or financial capital definitely puts one through the ringer.

*This story was updated on September 10 to correct the size of Google’s investment in Calico.*

# I Hope I Get Old Before I Die

## I Hope I Get Old Before I Die

### Trying to stay young isn’t just futile: it’s also bad for you. Here’s how to think about aging in the era of ultra longevity.

I n the 20th century, thanks largely to clean water and antibiotics, the American lifespan increased by 30 years. Who doesn’t want even more, if new technologies like gene editing and nanomedicine can safely put them within our grasp? [As Neo.life describes it](https://medium.com/neodotlife/congratulations-you-made-it-89858919d504), it’s the most important story today: “how biology and technology are coming together to help us all live healthier, happier, and longer lives.” But the challenge for all of us, no matter our age, is to not frame it as an “anti-aging” story. Here’s a pro-aging take on each of those modifiers — *healthier*, *happier,* and *longer* lives — starting with life extension itself.

**Goal #1: longer lives**

Aging isn’t something debilitating that bushwhacks us somewhere north of mid-life. Aging is living and living means aging. Nor is aging a disease; otherwise life, too, would be a disease. As British journalist Anne Karpf put it to NPR’s Brian Lehrer, “You can no more be anti-aging than anti-breathing.” Part of the distinction is semantic: make the target “age-related functional decline,” not “aging.” The “root cause of aging” is the passage of time, not cell senescence. At the end of all that living, we die. If the goal is to prevent death, whether by freezing ourselves in cryonic vats or by achieving what scientist Aubrey de Grey calls “longevity escape velocity,” let’s describe it accurately: not anti-aging but anti-dying.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m intrigued by the regenerative potential of tissues and organs, and all in favor of more research into the biology of aging. Until we understand what happens to our cells and organ systems far better than we do now, no health promotion strategy will have much of an effect on average life expectancy and maximum lifespan. More years of healthy life would be wonderful. But just as the enemy is disease, not aging, the goal needs to be health, not youth.

**Goal #2: healthier lives**

I like the way bio-entrepreneur Craig Venter puts it in a Neo.life article called “[The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts](https://medium.com/neodotlife/the-anti-aging-habits-of-longevity-experts-b2f3997f3091)*”*: “I’m trying to use the best of scientific knowledge to be as healthy as I can for as long as I can.” Like all the experts quoted in that story, Venter is engaged in the most effective “anti-aging” behavior of all: pursuing a goal. Long-term studies show that even with brains full of plaques and tangles, some people stayed sharp to the end. What did they have in common? A sense of purpose. What’s the biggest obstacle to having a sense of purpose in late life? A culture that tells us that getting older means shuffling offstage. Aging with purpose means rewriting that script.

A growing body of fascinating research shows that attitudes toward aging have measurable effects on how our minds and bodies function. People who don’t equate aging with disability and decline walk faster, do better on memory tests, and are more likely to recover fully from severe disability. That’s why the World Health Organization is developing a global anti-ageism campaign: to extend not just lifespan but “healthspan.” Not coincidentally, people with positive feelings about getting older also live longer — and they live better.

How worried are you about getting older, and why? Has what you dreaded come to pass? Check your age bias. It segregates us, pits us against each other, and fuels needless fears — and it might be your biggest health risk.

**Goal #3: happier lives**

Even in Silicon Valley, tied with Hollywood as the most ageist place on the planet, people know that tans and Teslas aren’t what make us happy. What does? Aging itself. Study after study shows that people are happiest at the beginnings and the ends of their lives; Google “U shaped happiness curve.” You don’t have to be a Buddhist or a billionaire, because the curve is a function of the way aging itself affects the brain. We get better at dealing with negative emotions like anger, envy, and fear. The knowledge that time is short makes us focus on the present and spend our time more wisely — and living in the present is why the very young and very old enjoy life the most. That’s what the “mindfulness” mania is constantly reminding us, and why so many myths couple immortality and misery.

![](1*n8v08KjQfc1Orw0Pup4PSQ.png)

As wise people across countries and cultures continue to remind us, there’s no present if there’s no ending. Not dealing with dying is a way of not dealing with living. Who wants more life, if it indeed becomes ours for the taking, if it comes without self-awareness or fulfillment or contentment? More reason to drop the anti-aging rhetoric, and the denial that fuels it. It keeps us from enjoying the present, and it feeds the narrative that aging well means looking and acting like younger versions of ourselves. Only the well-off can pursue that strategy, which is doubly discriminatory for women — and futile.

**Imagine a new goal: age equality**

Perhaps, not too long from now, we’ll be able to make the body of an octogenarian function as well as of that of a 30-year-old. That’ll be fantastic, especially if the advances become accessible to all. But 85 won’t be the new 30. It’ll be the new 85. And even the fittest octogenarians will be second-class citizens until we challenge the last socially sanctioned prejudice. Making the most of the new longevity means ending ageism.

Why does “anti-aging” sound normal and “pro-aging” sound weird? Because we’re brainwashed by a ruthless consumer culture. Who says wrinkles are ugly? The multi-billion-dollar skin care industry. Who says perimenopause and “Low T” and “mild cognitive impairment” are medical conditions? The trillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. Unless you count sunscreen, no “anti-aging” remedies are effective, and many have proven harmful. Aging is not a disorder. Yes, it strips us of cartilage and shortens our telomeres, but it also confers confidence, contentment, even grace. You can’t live longer without getting older — and that’s a very good thing.

# What Keeps a CRISPR Creator Up at Night

## Gene-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna’s new book reveals her dreams and nightmares about what she has unleashed.

![Illustration by Eric Petersen](1*Mr4L2E-CuWELQO57-9y8mg.png)*Illustration by Eric Petersen*

Adolf Hitler came to her in a dream, wearing a pig’s face and asking excitedly about what she had just invented.

That nightmare — and her willingness to share the story — reveals a lot about Jennifer Doudna, a biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley, and her new book, *A Crack in Creation*. It’s the story of how she co-developed CRISPR-Cas9, a method for editing DNA that is almost as cheap and easy for biologists as cutting and pasting letters on a word processor.

Doudna and French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier startled the bio-world in 2012 when they published their first CRISPR paper in [*Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6096/816)*. Almost overnight they had ushered in a long-anticipated moment when humans could more easily [bioengineer themselves](https://medium.com/neodotlife/q-a-enriquez-1c7d47c4a6ea).

In the five years since, Doudna’s quiet life as a researcher has been upended by magazine cover stories and marquee appearances at TED and the World Economic Forum in Davos, plus talk of her and Charpentier as shoo-ins for a Nobel Prize. Investors and entrepreneurs have raced to start companies based on the technology, raising hundreds of millions of dollars, even while legal battles rage over the patents for technologies that others have refined after Doudna and Charpentier’s initial paper.

The CRISPR technique hijacks a mechanism used by bacteria to remember the identity of invading viruses: they cut and paste sequences of the interloper’s DNA. Doudna and Charpentier’s insight was that this process could be made to happen with DNA in any organism, including humans.

Advocates expect CRISPR to soon allow physicians to edit glitches in some people’s DNA, correcting mutations for the likes of cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease; some forms of blindness; and possibly HIV. Scientists have already had success in altering human cells to edit out some of the mutations responsible for these diseases. Researchers in China last year were the first to try CRISPR in humans, injecting edited cells into a patient with lung cancer. Other trials in China, the U.S., and the U.K. are planned for this year.

Researchers have used CRISPR to tweak tomatoes to be less squishy and to bioengineer super-muscular dogs, micro-pigs the size of house cats, and hornless cows. Doudna also describes a CRISPR future that could bring us woolly mammoths, winged lizards, and unicorns.

CRISPR remains in its early days, however. General safety issues in humans still to be worked out, including,** **as Doudna writes**, **the possibility of “off-target” edits that occasionally occur in stretches of DNA beyond the intended location. This could be devastating if it happened in a human, although Doudna and other scientists believe that fine-tuning CRISPR should eliminate this problem. We’ll see.

In *A Crack in Creation*, Doudna and co-author Samuel Sternberg, a former PhD student in her lab, clearly describe CRISPR science and the compelling story of how Doudna and Charpentier accidently discovered it while investigating immune mechanisms in bacteria.

This is just a prelude, however, to the real reason that Doudna and Sternberg wrote this book, and wrote it now rather than waiting for years or decades to tell their story like most scientists and inventors. This emerges in the second half of the book as Doudna describes her apprehensions that CRISPR might be used for evil, and her efforts to make sure the world is aware of the potential downsides even as we revel in its possibilities.

As Doudna notes, most scientists and inventors prefer to stay in their labs and let others discuss the societal impacts of their discoveries. As a quiet person by nature, Doudna readily admits that this is her preference, too. Except that her conscience won’t let her stay out of the fray as visions of possible misuses literally haunt her — as with the Hitler dream.

She fears that CRISPR will be used to create designer people, and that scientists will use the technique to edit the so-called germline cells in human sperm, eggs, and embryos. These alterations would be passed down to children and subsequent generations, with unpredictable consequences.
> # It is heartening to see her weigh in early and forcefully to help steer us in the right direction.

In early 2015, Doudna acted on her qualms and gathered a group of 17 prominent scientists and ethicists in Napa Valley, California. The one-day meeting resulted in a letter calling for a moratorium on germline editing until ethical issues and safety could be further discussed.

In taking this step Doudna followed the lead of one of the scientists she invited, Stanford molecular biologist Paul Berg, now 91 years old. In the 1970s Berg had a similar crisis of conscience as a scientist on the brink of a major discovery in genetics. That technique, recombinant DNA, made it possible to splice DNA from other organisms into bacteria. His response — also unusual for a scientist — was to convene a conference in Northern California that sought to sort out the promise and the dangers of that technology. The rules that eventually came out of this process alleviated public fears enough that Berg and others could carry on experiments that launched a wave of new industries — and won Berg a Nobel Prize.

After the small Napa gathering in 2015, Doudna helped spearhead a global summit attended by 500 scientists, ethicists, and others from 20 countries in Washington, D.C. It ended with Doudna and other organizers issuing a statement that endorsed the eventual use of germline editing, but only in a very narrow set of cases where CRISPR could be used to edit out horrific diseases. And only after a host of ethical and safety issues are resolved.

One senses that *A Crack in Creation* isn’t Jennifer Doudna’s last word on the potential perils of CRISPR, although she has offered up an exceptional primer for why this technology needs to be openly discussed in all its facets. We may not be able to prevent a mad scientist or a just plain madman from abusing this discovery. But it is heartening to see one of its creators feeling the moral responsibility to weigh in early and forcefully to help steer us in the right direction.

# Get Up To Speed on Life Extension

## Jamie Metzl makes you smarter about the science of longevity research.

![Jamie Metzl at SXSW 2018](1*OU1w9oO30EVXnQ1FgBcXSA.jpeg)*Jamie Metzl at SXSW 2018*

I n his 2016 novel [*Eternal Sonata](https://www.amazon.com/Eternal-Sonata-Thriller-Near-Future/dp/1628726792/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526576140&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Eternal+Sonata&_encoding=UTF8&tag=neodotlife-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=08d8d8a4616691d175d89f4d20362478&camp=1789&creative=9325)*, Jamie Metzl [described](http://jamiemetzl.com/books/) a near future in which scientists are reversing aging with stem cell treatments and the DNA of jellyfish.

It’s science fiction, but the science is not quite fictional. When it comes to understanding how advances in biomedicine and genetics are converging in longevity research, Metzl—a [polymath](http://jamiemetzl.com/) who has held positions in international affairs in the U.S. government and for the United Nations—does his homework.

You can benefit from that by checking out the talk he gave at SXSW in March. Metzl offers a handy primer on the most [promising threads in longevity science](https://medium.com/neodotlife/search?q=longevity) and spins an engaging story along the way, ranging from the Epic of Gilgamesh to a 19th century fad for testicular transplants.

Grand as this tale is, the quest to increase human “health span” and life span is just part of [an even bigger story](https://medium.com/neodotlife/congratulations-you-made-it-89858919d504). As Metzl puts it: “After 3.8 billion years of evolution, by the principles that we all learned a long time ago—the Darwinian principles of random mutation and natural selection—we are turning a corner in our evolutionary trajectory as a species, moving toward a future where we will increasingly direct our own evolutionary process.”

# His Longevity Pill Won’t Work For Her

## Research on aging treatments keeps turning up profound variations in how male and female subjects respond.

![Illustration by Nicolás Ortega](1*oce3BYQTvyARaR39x_PzPA.jpeg)*Illustration by Nicolás Ortega*

There’s a drug that makes mice live 8 percent longer — but only if they’re male. Female mice get roughly that amount of benefit from a totally different treatment, which does nothing for males.

These aren’t just one-off quirks in longevity research. A growing body of scientific research suggests that getting older plays out very differently in males and females. To make [significant progress](https://medium.com/neodotlife/juvenescence-jim-mellon-longevity-e9a415dd0569) in fighting the diseases associated with aging, researchers will have to better understand and address these sex disparities.

“Males and females are more different organisms than we had originally appreciated, especially when it comes to longevity,” says David Sinclair, a geneticist and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging at Harvard Medical School.

Life expectancy for women is generally longer than for men. In the United States, a girl born in 2014 [could expect](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_04.pdf) to live past age 81, while a boy was likely to survive five years less, to 76.5. The same is true in other higher-order primates, including monkeys and apes, research [shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25968226), although the pattern is not consistent across other mammal species.


But early anti-aging research, like most scientific investigations, focused just on male animals. Even when their experiments were in Petri dishes, scientists generally used cells from males.

“For years, people just didn’t really think there was going to be any difference,” says Derek Huffman, an associate professor of molecular pharmacology and medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. “I think we’re finding out that that is a very dangerous assumption to make.”

In the early 1990s, the U.S. National Institutes of Health began requiring sex balance in the clinical trials it funded. But in 2014, the institutes realized that basic research was still largely [biased toward male animals](https://www.popsci.com/male-female-research-subjects#page-2). Francis Collins, the head of the NIH, demanded more balance. “We’re now at a point where you can’t do a serious study without including females,” says Sinclair, who adds that this has essentially doubled the cost of research.

Once they began looking, longevity researchers [realized](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12496) that male and female animals responded very differently to medications intended to promote healthy aging. For instance, male mice [live about 8 percent longer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695675/) if given the equivalent of a low-dose aspirin a day; female mice see no such benefit. Likewise, a weak form of estrogen called 17α-Estradiol has been [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26809497) to extend the life span of male mice and do nothing for females.
> # “There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to it.”

Female mice, on the other hand, live 14 percent longer than expected when given [rapamycin](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08221), which is used to prevent organ rejection after kidney transplants, while males get a 9 percent boost. And in a study [published in June](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04805-5) in *Nature Communications*, Huffman showed that the growth hormone IGF-1 extends the healthy life span of female mice by 9 percent, while doing little for male mice.

“There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to it,” Sinclair says.

The disparities seem to exist in people, too, says Brian Kennedy, director of the center for healthy aging at the National University of Singapore and a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California. “My guess is there will be correspondence between what we see in mice and humans,” he says.

There’s a lot of speculation about why this is so, but no hard evidence.

The immediate assumption is that the difference has to do with hormones. Males are exposed to a lifetime of testosterone; females to estrogen. Studies show that men who have been castrated live longer than men who haven’t been, suggesting that testosterone may shorten life span.

The immune system also seems to play a crucial — and sex-dependent — role in aging. Male immune systems apparently weaken faster than their female counterparts, says Huffman. And drugs that address inflammation seem to provide more longevity benefit to males than females — at least in mice.
> # “We’re now at a point where you can’t do a serious study without including females.”

One particularly odd thing in humans is that though women live longer, they are nonetheless more prone to miserable but non-deadly ailments such as arthritis, Huffman says. Lethal illnesses such as heart disease and cancer strike men more often. (Although Alzheimer’s strikes women more than men, for unknown reasons.)

There’s no clear explanation for this paradox, Huffman says. “That’s a story still to be told.”

### Ultra-personalized longevity

To complicate this picture further, the gender differences don’t always crop up. In a study [published Monday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0092-9) in *Nature Medicine*, mice of both sexes got the same increase in healthy life span from drugs that cleared out so-called “senescent cells” — ones that are too old or damaged to reproduce.

Why might that be? James Kirkland, the paper’s senior author and director of the Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging at the Mayo Clinic, says it’s possibly because senescence is such a fundamental biological process that it affects both sexes equally. But he really doesn’t know. (Kirkland says he wouldn’t recommend that people take “senolytic” drugs to clear out these senescent cells because the side effects remain largely unexplored.)

Kennedy has been wondering whether sex differences in aging can be explained by the activity of genes on the Y chromosome. (Men have an X and a Y chromosome; women have two X’s). He’s now tinkering with the sex chromosome of mice — making some males with XX, for instance, to see if the difference disappears.

Sex differences should also serve as a reminder, Kennedy says, that researchers need to be looking at variations by ethnicity and other factors, too. If he’s right, treating aging will be just like most areas of medicine: it will have to be personalized by many things. Longevity won’t be as easy to achieve as simply handing everyone the same pill.

*This story was updated on July 16 to correct the description of Kirkland’s reason for caution about senolytic drugs.*

# Blockchains Won’t Fix the Problem with Genomics

## Blockchains Won’t Fix the Problem with Genomics

### If you’ve been waiting to get your genome sequenced, will a virtual token really make you change your mind?

This is shaping up to be the year of DNA for cryptocurrency. One [startup](https://gizmodo.com/should-you-sell-your-dna-on-the-internet-1822117457) [after](https://www.thedailybeast.com/startup-wants-to-sell-your-dna-for-cryptocurrency) [another](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5dq8b/insilico-blockchain-medical-data-cryptocurrency) is offering to pay you in bitcoin-like tokens for sharing your genetic data. The newest of these involves genetics researcher and publicity magnet George Church, who is part of a startup, Nebula Genomics, that will sequence your genome for around $1,000 and connect you to groups that want to buy access to it. You’d be paid in Nebula’s virtual tokens, and a record of which companies or researchers have accessed your genomic data would be stored on a blockchain.

But it’s hard to see how using blockchains and cryptocurrencies will substantially increase demand for genome sequencing. That’s a vexing problem because too few genomes have been sequenced and analyzed to generate as many meaningful insights as scientists had hoped. As recently as 2016, [only 20 percent](https://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759) of whole-genome sequences were from non-white people, and without access to the full variation of human DNA, researchers [don’t know enough](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/genetic-testing/article37829424/) about which variants actually cause or influence disease.


Another issue is that genomic data is near useless to researchers by itself. Its utility comes when paired with data about your phenotype — the traits and conditions you have. That information is found in places like your electronic health record or a medical survey. So whether these startups record transactions on a blockchain matters less than whether they will be able to gather and manage phenotypic data. It’s thornier to handle than DNA data; it’s messier and comes in many different types.

Nebula wasn’t the first company to hit upon the idea of using a blockchain as the basis for a genomic data marketplace, although it’s apparently the only one that will also sequence your genome for you. EncrypGen, Luna DNA, Longenesis, and Zenome also use blockchains to record how researchers and companies interact with your DNA data. But in these cases you bring a genetic readout that you’ve obtained from other companies, including those like 23andMe or Ancestry.com that don’t sequence full genomes.

Blockchains have strong privacy advantages for genomic data. A blockchain is essentially a public record that, in this case, would track every time your data is used. That record is nearly hack-proof because it is replicated in many different places within a network and anyone can access it. Drug companies or academic researchers couldn’t use your data without your knowledge. This is in stark contrast to the way much of your data is treated right now, says Polina Mamoshina, senior research scientist at Insilico Medicine, which is partnering with bitcoin miner BitFury to form Longenesis. “There is a hidden data market right now, and a lot of companies are selling our data, which is super valuable, without us knowing about it,” says Mamoshina.
> # “It’s hard to say whether people are going to do this.”

As an additional privacy protection, Nebula will also not allow anyone to download an individual’s genetic data. “A good analogy is they get to rent it; they get to run code on top of it,” says one of Nebula’s founders, Kamal Obbad. “All they get in return is the results.” He says that because the rented data would be fully anonymized, it would be impossible for, say, an insurance company to deny you coverage based on information they learn from your genome.

But using a blockchain and reaping its privacy benefits means paying people in a cryptocurrency. Paying them in dollars would require some central entity to serve as middleman and make the payments. Even aside from talk of a cryptocurrency bubble, Nebula’s tokens will only be useful within Nebula’s network, as researchers or companies who want to query Nebula’s database of genomic data pay for the access. In theory, this allows people who share their data to capture a fair portion of the value it helps to create. But if there aren’t enough buyers interested in using Nebula’s particular network, the tokens will be worth little or nothing. Meanwhile, [you can instead get cash](https://medium.com/neodotlife/dna-wants-to-be-free-d2dd205667f9) for sharing your genomic data with companies like DNASimple or Genos.

“It’s hard to say whether people are going to do this,” Mamoshina acknowledges. That’s why Longenesis also plans to store other data that might be useful to researchers even in the absence of DNA, including such phenotypic information as blood tests, data from wearables, and even selfies. Nebula also plans to collect not just genomes but also health surveys, electronic health records, and data from wearables, Obbad says.

These varying types of data are tricky to work with, though. “Integrating different kinds of data is a non-trivial challenge in machine learning and health care, and that’s true no matter how much data you have,” says Marzyeh Ghassemi, a visiting researcher at Google Verily and a postdoctoral researcher at MIT. Obbad agrees: “It’s a big challenge that hasn’t been solved yet.” In other words, the ultimate utility of these genetic marketplaces will probably depend on this open question of how well they’ll deal with information other than genomes. Genomes get the headlines but are comparatively easy to handle.

All the while, there’s the fact that we haven’t sequenced a diverse enough swath of genomes to have really great knowledge about what they mean for disease and human health. Blockchain genomic data marketplaces tout their ability to recruit new people to share genomic data, but they may just reach the same pool of people who are already interested in the subject. Ghassemi doubts that the use of a blockchain will encourage more diverse participation that better captures the actual variation in human genomes. “This is a hard problem,” she says, “and I don’t think it’s one that’s going to be addressed by purely technical solutions.”

# Our Genetic Legacy

## I am not afraid of the prospect of editing human genes. If we do it thoughtfully, it can be a gift to future generations.

Consider, for a moment, how you would feel knowing that you were the product of direct design by your parents. Not just via reproductive choice — they likely chose one another with a vague idea of the possible outcomes their children would embody — but through purposeful design, careful crafting of the traits your genes dictate. It would give a whole new meaning to parental expectations and external pressure. Would you feel gratitude that they chose particular traits valued by our culture? Or resentment that they chose anything at all? Would you feel ownership over your accomplishments in life, or would these accomplishments be — in some larger way — attributable to the genetic design implemented by your parents?

This is an interesting thought experiment, in part because in the not-too-distant future our descendants will likely be having this kind of experience.

Already a growing number of laboratories, institutes, companies, and artists are exploring ways to quantify our bodies, to modify ourselves and our environments to optimize performance and drive particular outcomes. Businesses are offering ways to measure your health across a number of parameters, promising to synthesize the data and provide actionable information to improve health and wellness. As a young woman, as an athlete, the notion of the quantified self and the goal of radical wellness speak to me. I think about extending my window of fertility, relieving the pressure to have kids during this early and bustling phase of my career. I imagine hitting a personal record on my deadlift at the local CrossFit gym when I’m 80. I dream of playing with my great grandchildren at 100 years old.

Who wouldn’t want to tune their body for optimal performance and health? Who doesn’t want to live a better life, for longer? But when it comes to modifying the basic building blocks of our very species — our genes, and inherently our cells and organs — we are taking things a step further. A new and improved human genome will likely change the human image. A 45-year-old man today will not look like a 45-year-old in 2300 AD. Consider photographs from the late 1800s. Many of the men, women and children look *different* than people of the same age in today’s world. The human image will change, and so will our behaviors, societies, and cultures.

When we alter the fundamental building blocks that make up who we are, we are also changing the nature of our humanity. But we shouldn’t fear it as being unnatural. We should think of it as a gift, a chance to design our legacy.

### Humans as GMOs

For the small group of diseases that are the sole result of losing the genetic lottery, this is a revolutionary moment. Just last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first gene therapy to treat an inherited disease — a rare form of retinal dystrophy that leads to vision loss. There are hundreds of gene therapies being developed and tested in clinical trials for patients around the world who have limited alternative options.


But the scope of these genetic changes is small compared to the alterations future humans will likely make. For example, there are rare protective gene variants that have an outsize impact on our health and well-being. Some of these are associated with low risk of cancer (*GHR *and* GH*), others facilitate extra strong bones (*LRP5*), lean muscles (*MSTN*) and even viral resistance (*CCR5 *and *FUT2*). What if we were to “install” genes that offer lifelong protection against infection, Alzheimer’s, and perhaps even aging itself? What if we could [prevent the propagation](https://medium.com/neodotlife/imperfect-pregnancies-and-the-language-of-genomics-e0e2da7a20c1) of genetic human diseases in future generations, much like we have largely eradicated many infectious diseases through immunization? When we begin changing the scope of human disease and suffering, we begin changing the human experience. And if we can do that, we might have to ask whether we in fact have a moral imperative to do so.

Many critics of genetic engineering argue that tinkering with genes is “unnatural.” Outspoken critics of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been protesting the technology and agricultural products for many years, citing safety concerns or fears that modifying the DNA of an organism renders it somehow less safe to eat or grow. However, we are entering an era where humans are the GMOs, and many people’s health and well-being will depend on the ability to genetically modify their cells. It doesn’t make sense to keep a death-grip on preserving that which seems “natural.” We influence or engineer much of our world to suit our needs, often without any consideration other than that it is more convenient and supports our busy lives. We use hearing aids, prosthetics, and other things that we don’t *need* to survive but that make our lives better, not to mention tummy tucks and breast implants. We have been doing unnatural things to our bodies for centuries.
> # I believe we will get staged genetic treatments, much as we receive a barrage of vaccines early in life to train our immune system.

So what if we were to take this perspective, marry it to a more thoughtful intention, and apply it to re-envisioning the future human species? To our children, our children’s children, and their children? We are responsible for their ability to thrive, and we are becoming capable of evolving a more resilient future human. One that will not only be free of hereditary disease, but that will outperform and outlast the humans of today.

We’re not yet ready to edit human embryos or germ line cells whose changes will be passed on through future generations. Indeed, while researchers in China have already attempted genetic modifications in nonviable human embryos, an international committee convened by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine concluded that editing the DNA of a human embryo “might be permitted, but only following much more research” on the risks and benefits, and “only for compelling reasons under strict oversight.” Their report called for an ongoing reassessment, including public participation, before any heritable germ line editing is permitted. We are still a ways away from this.

However, in 50 years’ time, if we are not already making genetic changes to the human germ line — especially for universally fatal diseases like Huntington’s disease — I believe we will be undergoing staged genetic treatments, much as we receive a barrage of vaccines early in life to train our immune system. But rather than training our immune system, we will be training our DNA to produce cells, tissues, organs, and ultimately a body that is better equipped to handle the stressors of modern life, and to enable an increased health span to pair with our increasing life span. To avoid the known genetic traps that inevitably lead to disease. Or to enable creation of a sturdier physical body to move through the world with agility, strength, and cognitive function, well into our 70s, 80s and beyond.

![](1*BP1u76fvnj2orVTz7bfrkQ.png)

As a scientist, the promise of this is incredibly exciting. Not only because of what it allows us to learn, but also how it allows us to grow and evolve. To prepare us for the coming centuries of life on Earth, or perhaps beyond. As a humanist, I want to help create a world where “preventable” describes most diseases. It was only 55 years ago that the first genetic test was administered to infants, facilitating treatment of a disease known as PKU before its effects took hold. What diseases can we treat, cure, or prevent altogether in the next 55 years? In the next 100?

As we begin changing our genes, the fundamental units that make us human, we are disrupting a connection to our past. It might not be possible for people 200 years from now to use DNA to track their ancestry. We might lose what’s known as longitudinal data. But we are *gaining* a stronger legacy. We are holding the evolution of humans in our hands.

I hope we can bring about change soon enough so that my parents can continue to thrive physically and cognitively for decades to come. So that they can meet their great-grandchildren and hold their legacy in their arms. This is our future. We must push forward; thoughtfully, carefully, but forward nonetheless, to give the inheritors of our legacy what we wish for ourselves: a greater health span. A greater life span. A better life.

# Your Guide to Getting Sequenced

## A handy chart for sorting out many of the options in DNA analysis.

It’s now possible to get your entire genome sequenced for about $1,000, which is amazing. That’s a readout of six billion letters of your DNA, the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that spell out who you are. But for less than $100 you can get DNA tests that provide an interesting snapshot. Which should you choose?

Our guide below is meant to help. It lists the offerings of 16 consumer-focused genetics companies and organizations, whether [they’ll pay you back](https://medium.com/neodotlife/dna-wants-to-be-free-d2dd205667f9) if your DNA is used by researchers, and the format of any genomic data they give you.

A quick explanation of the terms. **Genotyping** is the cheapest DNA service. Your genes are compared to a standard “reference genome” at something like 500,000 or one million different spots that tend to vary a lot between people. (These variations are known as SNPs, or single-nucleotide polymorphisms, tweaks of a single letter of DNA.) Genotyping can [explain](https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/202907980-What-unexpected-things-might-I-learn-from-23andMe-) why you have various traits, shed light on your ancestry and reveal certain medical risks. **Exome **sequencing will find medical insights and many other things about you that genotyping does not. It decodes all the stretches of your DNA that are converted into functioning proteins — about 1.5 percent of your genome. **Whole genome** sequencing is the most thorough. In theory, it translates every single letter in your genome. In practice, some regions that are difficult to sequence get skipped, so sequencing is usually done 20 or even 50 or 100 times to catch errors. That’s known as 20x, 50x, or 100x “coverage.”

If you want your actual DNA readout and not just a counselor’s interpretation of it, you can get it in various formats. A sequencing machine produces a **FASTQ** file, with long strings of letters. You’ll probably want those fragments reassembled into a **SAM** (Sequence Alignment/Map) or **BAM** (Binary Alignment/Map) file, both of which could be useful for various DNA-analysis services. Providers might also send you a variant call format (**VCF**) file, a comparison of your DNA against a reference genome to highlight what’s unique. Or they could send a **text** file that lists hundreds of thousands of variations and their locations in the genome.

# A Silk Robe for Your Next Implant

## A Silk Robe for Your Next Implant

You probably know that spider silk is a wonder material because it’s super strong despite being light and stretchy. But silk has another magnificent quality that is now being put to use inside the human body.

Because [it is made of proteins ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658765/)that the immune system isn’t inclined to fight, spider silk could make an ideal protective coating for medical implants that otherwise can cause irritation and even rejection in extreme cases. In an experiment underway in Europe, women are receiving silicone breast implants that have been coated with a minuscule layer of artificial silk made by AMSilk, a German company that uses genetically engineered e. coli bacteria to churn out silk proteins. The silk coating eventually wears away and harmlessly degrades, but it’s there long enough for the body to adjust to the implant by forming a capsule of tissue around it, says Lin Römer, AMSilk’s chief science officer.

If these coated implants perform as expected, AMSilk hopes to use the technology on other medical devices, such as pacemakers, and then on electronic implants yet to come. In other words, a material that is millions of years old could smooth the way for body computers of the future. “Our body does not know silicon. Our body does not know polypropylene,” Römer says. “Our body does know proteins.”

# These Genes May Help You Read Your Biological Clock

## These Genes May Help You Read Your Biological Clock

### Newly discovered variants let women predict their fertility — and overall health.

A genetic study of 75,000 23andMe users may help young women predict their fertility timeline — and cast new light on women’s health more generally.

Celmatix, a diagnostics company in New York City, announced results today from the largest study to date of the genetics of early menopause. The condition, also called premature ovarian failure or primary ovarian insufficiency, affects 1 in 100 women under the age of 40. The study, which reports that variants in two genes increase a woman’s risk of developing this condition by 19 percent, was presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual congress in Denver this week.

Previous, smaller studies had hinted that these genetic variants play a role in early menopause, but they included too few women to generate conclusive results. The unprecedented scale of this study makes the new results more convincing — and potentially useful.


When a woman’s ovaries stop releasing eggs, and the production of estrogen and other hormones like progesterone declines, it becomes nearly impossible for her to conceive naturally. For most women, that happens between the ages of 45 and 55; when it happens to women in their 20s or 30s, it is considered early menopause. It’s not just a fertility problem: Early menopause can also increase a woman’s risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and even breast and ovarian cancer.

That’s why testing for these variants could be useful for many women, not just those trying to get pregnant, says Celmatix founder and CEO Piraye Beim. “This [genetic] risk factor still matters for women who’ve made up their mind not to have children because it could be a canary in a coalmine for other things,” she says.

Several genetic panels are already on the market that can assess some risk factors for early menopause: Blueprint Genetics, GeneDx, the University of Chicago, and even Celmatix’s own [Fertilome test](https://medium.com/neodotlife/fertilome-celmatix-piraye-beim-genes-and-fertility-4b1ee7b26ff5) all offer this service. However, these tests do not include the new variants because they were developed using what’s called a “candidate gene” approach, scanning for variants in genes that are already known to be involved with the underlying biology of that particular condition. That’s only useful if you know how a disorder works and what genes to look for.
> # It’s not just a fertility problem: Early menopause can also increase a woman’s risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and even breast and ovarian cancer.

If the mechanisms of a disorder are poorly understood, as with early menopause, this approach may miss some important genes. Current versions of Fertilome have identified risk factors in 84 percent of Celmatix customers**,** but for 16 percent the condition was unexplained.

The company’s new study is a genome-wide association study, which means it starts at the other end — it looks in an unbiased way at a large population and finds commonalities in the genetic code of those who have a disorder in common. In this case, 3,219 of the 75,000 women in the 23andMe group reported that they’d had early menopause, allowing the research team to pinpoint associated variations in the genes *BRSK1* and *TMEM150B*, which have not been included in existing panels.

*BRSK1* normally acts as a checkpoint that stops a cell with damaged DNA from duplicating, and *TMEM150B* checks for cell quality control. Variants in these genes may cause a woman’s ovarian cells to die off more quickly, but the exact mechanisms underlying early menopause are still unknown.

![](1*WPpTRVllY7qOkM_-6YwMGg.png)

“These types of studies are critically important to keep pushing us to further elucidate what the factors are that affect fertility and beyond,” says Stacey Missmer, a reproductive epidemiologist who teaches at both the Harvard School of Public Health and Michigan State University, and wasn’t involved in the Celmatix study. Women’s health has historically been understudied and the research into it under-funded, creating these kinds of knowledge gaps, she says.

Celmatix hopes to add these variants to its Fertilome test, but the company has not said when this will happen. The test, which must be ordered by a doctor, is currently not covered by insurance and costs $950.

**A chance to beat the clock**

Today, most women find out they’re going through early menopause only when it’s already too late — when they’re trying to get pregnant and cannot. At that point, not much can be done to restore fertility, although some treatments can address symptoms of early menopause.

Since most women assume they will be fertile well into their 30s, this discovery can be a painful surprise. “You are an individual and the shape of your [fertility timeline] may look different,” says Beim. And when it doesn’t work out for them, “women who base their life plans on these averages end up feeling very frustrated.”

Beim hopes that in the future a test that includes this new information will help more young women who plan to one day have children — especially those with a family history of early menopause — take fertility-preserving steps such as egg freezing while they still have time. It could also help any woman with the condition take preventive measures against the diseases associated with early menopause and those that become more common in women after menopause, such as stroke.
> # **Since most women assume they will be fertile well into their 30s, this discovery can be a painful surprise.**

Genome-wide association studies generally require generous funding and large populations, like the 75,000 women studied here, in order to reliably associate gene variants with disorders and diseases. Typically, a study this large would be challenging to execute with public money, says Missmer: “It’s extremely difficult to get funding to begin a rigorous, large-scale project that’s specifically focused on reproductive health” in academia, she says. “It feels like begging, borrowing, and stealing to do this work.”

Celmatix got its large pool of subjects by partnering with 23andMe, which provided the company with information from volunteers who had agreed to share their data for research. However, this wealth of data comes with a limitation: 23andMe’s customer base is dominated by people of European ancestry, and in this case the study was conducted only with people of that background. That means that any potential future test may not be as accurate for people of other ethnicities, although in previous smaller studies these variants were linked to age at menopause in African-American, Han Chinese, and Hispanic populations. Fertilome’s current version includes a disclaimer indicating that gene frequencies and associations may vary among ethnicities.

Beim says Celmatix plans to address this limitation with another, broader fertility study of about 4,500 women of diverse backgrounds, who are more representative of American demographics. “We don’t understand a lot about women’s health in general. We understand even less about the health of women of color, and that’s a real problem,” says Beim. That study is now in its final months.

# You Can Rescue Medical Breakthroughs from the Valley of Death

## You Can Rescue Medical Breakthroughs from the Valley of Death

### Halo Cures, a crowdfunding startup, will usher new drugs and devices through the rockiest stage of development.

When Kevin Leland’s boss donated $500,000 to research in immunotherapy for gastric cancer, Leland wondered how he could do something as meaningful. The problem, though, was that he had nowhere near as much money as his boss, who was Eric Lefkofsky, the billionaire co-founder of Groupon. How, Leland wondered, could people like him substantially advance biomedical breakthroughs — especially if he wanted to fund cures for something in particular, rather than general causes like cancer or heart disease?

Leland came up with his answer a few years later. It’s a tiny startup called Halo Cures, which he launched in 2016. He describes it as a curated crowdfunding platform for new drugs and medical devices. It aims to raise money for specific, vetted projects that need only a relatively modest infusion of cash to bring them through a period known as the “valley of death,” when funding for product development can be scarce.


“We are connecting people,” Leland says, “who care about a particular disease or condition with the most promising research targeting that disease or condition.”

Leland, 38, conceived of the idea while living in Atlanta and working as the marketing director for a financial-technology company. To start Halo Cures, he moved to San Francisco with one piece of luggage and shared a room with a young polyamorous woman in a “community house” that accommodated roughly 40 other people. He soon upgraded — to a mattress on the floor of a closet in a two-bedroom apartment where eight other people lived.

It will all have been worthwhile if Halo can close the chasm between basic biomedical research and the creation of real therapies for patients.

“Halo is certainly the most interesting thing that I’ve seen in a while,” says Karthik Gopalakrishnan, associate director of life sciences at Duke University’s office of licensing and ventures.

Many things create the valley of death. Because basic research garners more prestige and career prospects, graduate students and postdocs eschew translational research — a field that’s necessary to develop a drug or device. There’s also a knowledge gap, as [fewer of today’s researchers](https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2012/03010/Perspective___Transforming_Science_Into_Medicine.11.aspx) are also clinical doctors than in past decades.

Sometimes, Leland says, a fledgling project doesn’t need that much money to get it through the valley. For example, once researchers have identified a molecule as a promising drug, they may only need $200,000 to develop it to the point that a pharmaceutical company will take a chance on it and fund clinical trials. It’s this latter stage that’s the most expensive part of biomedical research, costing millions of dollars before approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Halo’s goal isn’t necessarily to fund a project all the way through — just to help it become more attractive for major investors.

![](1*1JR19rFFhLXoUAvHO-7ERQ.png)

However, even with Halo’s help, an investment in a new drug would entail considerable risk. A drug that reaches the clinical phase of development still has only a 10 percent chance of success, says Michael Kurilla, the director of the clinical innovation division at the NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. For its part, the center is trying to bridge the valley of death by providing funding and training through its [Clinical and Translational Science Awards](https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa).

Because they tend to be cheaper to develop than drugs, devices may benefit more from crowdfunding. Indeed, [Halo’s first campaign](https://www.halocures.com/campaigns/anorectal-malformation), which kicked off last month, is raising money for a surgical device developed by Philip Frykman, a surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He believes the device gives surgeons a better way to fix a rare birth defect that leaves babies with a malformed rectum. He’s used the instrument in other countries, but to bring it to the U.S. he needs $500,000 for further testing and FDA approval. He’s raised more than $100,000 through Halo so far.

Halo’s not alone in trying some version of crowdfunding for medical innovation. [RedCrow](https://www.redcrow.com/), co-founded by former Talking Heads keyboardist and guitarist Jerry Harrison, is connecting investors with startups in health and medicine. There also are crowdfunding platforms for scientific research, such as [Experiment](https://experiment.com/) and [Consano](http://www.consano.org/), launched by a cancer survivor, Molly Lindquist.

But unlike many other platforms, Halo will help promising projects with their marketing — Leland’s area of expertise — to shepherd them across the valley of death. Eventually, he wants to assemble small committees of experts to vet the projects. For now, he’s trying to partner with technology transfer offices at research institutions, relying on their expertise, credibility, and name recognition.

Halo is a for-profit company, charging an 8 percent fee on the money raised. But eventually, Leland hopes to eliminate the fee and grab a stake in whatever therapies or devices become successful. The company would act like a venture capital firm, except that the funding would come from donors — with no expectation of a return — instead of investors. Halo would, essentially, profit from people’s generosity.

That may seem exploitative, but Leland is confident that donors won’t mind: they want to cure a disease, not make money. “Because it’s been proven out in other spaces, I think it’s less of a leap to say that it can work for biotech as well,” he says. After all, people are plenty willing to give to companies like Oculus Rift, the virtual-reality developer that arose on Kickstarter and later was sold to Facebook for $2 billion.

The exact business model could still change, as Halo is brand-new. Leland is the only full-time employee, sometimes working out of another startup’s cramped office above a cannabis dispensary in San Francisco. His challenge, Gopalakrishnan says, will be to reach enough donors and build credibility and trust.

But if Halo works, research can surely benefit. There are always more worthy projects than available funding, Gopalakrishnan says: “Science is a beast. You can always keep feeding it money.”

# Curious Robots Will Teach Us About Ourselves

## Machines programmed to explore could lead to smarter AI — and show us how to unlock capacities lying dormant in our own brains.

![Illustration by Dominic Kesterton](1*XDo6EbNhu4XsvsI-3FQEKQ.gif)*Illustration by Dominic Kesterton*

Two robotic puppies sit on a baby play mat. One extends a paw and hits a dangling toy. It pauses and tries out its other limb a few times. After a few more experimental movements, it turns its head and lets out a cry like a plaintive jungle bird.

Nursery toys aside, [these robotic pooches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAoNzHjzzys) don’t seem to have much in common with human newborns. But in one important way, they are like people: They learn because they want to. And that is offering an unprecedented peek into what drives humanity’s fundamental inquisitiveness about the world.

Born fuzzy-eyed and barely in control of their limbs, human infants soon transform into mobile, chattering little creatures who play and experiment and invent. No one forces them to do this; given a basic level of stimulation and care, they just do. And neuroscientists have no idea how.

The robots might have the answer. Researchers hope that by creating algorithms that result in a robotic version of curiosity, they can get new ideas about how the human brain pulls off the same trick. An obvious goal is to build smarter, more flexible artificial intelligence, leading to machines that can extrapolate and learn without any outside prompting. But this work might also crack the code of brain processes that drive fundamental human behaviors: When and why are we curious? How do the interactions between our body and the environment drive our curiosity? And is there any way to manipulate curiosity, to make people more inquisitive or to make certain subjects pop?

“This is potentially a very transformative thing for the field of artificial intelligence, and even a little bit scary, because it raises the prospect of having machines that not only do something that you program them to do, but that can discover new patterns,” says Jacqueline Gottlieb, a neuroscientist at Columbia University’s Kavli Institute for Brain Science. Gottlieb is collaborating with the developer of the puppy robots, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer of the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation, on a project that will take hypotheses about curiosity generated in robotics experiments and test them in humans.

When robotics and cognitive science meet, it is often the latter informing the former: Researchers in artificial intelligence frequently look to human abilities and cognitive processes to try to mimic them in artificial systems. Oudeyer and his colleagues are interested in building robots that learn more like people do, too. But the main push of their Neurocuriosity Project, which launched in 2013 and was just funded for its second phase by an international project called the [Human Frontier Science Program](http://www.hfsp.org/), is to turn that robotics-neuroscience relationship on its head. “The goal is to help us understand better what’s happening in the human brain,” Oudeyer says.

Robotics are useful for this work because, unlike computer simulations, they have bodies. They perceive. They interact. Perhaps most importantly, they can be programmed to develop over time. And that process may be indispensable to intelligence. “We don’t have an example of an intelligent system [in nature] that did not go through a developmental period,” says Alexander Stoytchev, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Iowa State University who isn’t involved in Gottlieb and Oudeyer’s work.


A [paper published in 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/25/6874.full) in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* even posits that intelligence increases with the time it takes an animal to reach maturity: Humans take longer to wean their infants than baboons, which wean later than lemurs, for example. Chimpanzee babies walk earlier than human babies, which means human babies have several more months in the sitting-and-playing stage, mastering things like hand-eye coordination and cause-and-effect.

What piqued the interest of Oudeyer and his colleagues was the fact that human infants develop in idiosyncratic ways. All babies tend to flail around, then roll over, then crawl, then walk. But some walk at 10 months of age and some walk at 14 months. Some crawl on all fours and others scoot around on their bottoms. Whatever system the human brain uses, it’s both organized and open-ended.

It’s also driven by intrinsic curiosity, in very mysterious ways. Typically, Gottlieb says, people who research decision-making frame it as a process of weighing the options and picking the one that seems most valuable. But that doesn’t quite explain basic curiosity, because babies don’t know the value of their choices until long after they make them. “How can we make choices without knowing what the hell is going to happen?” Gottlieb says.

To explore that idea, the researchers programmed their puppy robots with very little information to start out. The bots could produce simple limb and head movements known as motor primitives. They could imitate the moves or sounds of a fellow robot. And they could keep track of what their movements did to their bodies and the surrounding environment. But that was about it.

The results, first published [in 2006](http://groups.lis.illinois.edu/amag/langev/paper/oudeyer06discoveryOfCommunication.html) [and 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518057/), were remarkably like human infant development. The robots made movements that seemed arbitrary at first, but they soon showed increasing purposefulness. Like human infants, they tended to have a general path of development, from simple tasks to more complex activities (grasping toys, then batting them around, then focusing on vocalizing, another “motor primitive” the researchers installed to study the development of language).
> # “This is potentially a very transformative thing for the field of artificial intelligence, and even a little bit scary.”

Crucially, the researchers found, this human-like development emerged when the robots were programmed to be motivated by their own progress: The more information the robots were likely to gain by trying out a new motion or vocalization, the more likely they were to give it a shot. This led them to move on from trying overly simple motions (no new information to be gleaned there) as well as overly complex ones (there’s no point in trying to waltz if you can’t even crawl). In other words, the intrinsic reward for learning — for having curiosity, basically — is the jolt that comes from unlocking just the right amount of information about the world with your actions.

There is evidence that humans, too, display a sort of “just-right” Goldilocks preference for stimuli. A [2012 paper in the journal *PLoS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036399)*, for example, found that 7- and 8-month-olds preferred to look at stimuli that were of midrange complexity.

However, it’s plausible that a mechanism that mimics human development in robots actually has nothing to do with how humans really learn. That’s why Gottlieb and her team are now trying to test in humans whether curiosity is indeed fueled by making progress at learning. The researchers are designing games of varying difficulty that people will explore on their own. They’ll then test the extent to which people’s choices in the games are dependent on their learning progress.

It’s not easy to test something as nebulous as curiosity in the lab, but the researchers are taking their own baby steps, driven forward by the lure of understanding just a little bit more. “It hasn’t been easy. We’ve been at it for a while,” Gottlieb says. “I think we’re learning from our mistakes, and we’re refining, and we’re getting somewhere.”

# DNA Is Overrated

## DNA Is Overrated

### Genes play a refreshingly limited role in Carl Zimmer’s new book about heredity.

“The subject of freedom and its enemies is enormous,” Aldous Huxley wrote in an essay distilling his novel *Brave New World*. The dystopian story is regularly evoked as a warning about human engineering, but Huxley’s own words suggest he had something else in mind, something bigger than genetic manipulation. Now, with his sweeping new book on heredity, *She Has Her Mother’s Laugh*, it feels as though Carl Zimmer has picked up on Huxley’s idea: that the letters of our genes matter much less than how we choose to influence their expression.

Set 500 years in the future, *Brave New World* begins, memorably, in a 34-story building labeled the “Hatchery and Conditioning Centre,” controlled by a global empire called World State. The hatchery is a factory for synthesizing human beings by the thousand. It features a conveyor belt of blood-filled test tubes and artificial wombs in which every person is conceived and gestated. Embryos pre-ordained to be of a higher caste receive superior prenatal treatment, while lower castes are poisoned during embryonic development.


World State’s aim is perfect societal stability: no unemployment, no hunger, no war, no disease, and no pain. There is also no art, no scientific inquiry, no exploration, no wild nature, and no love. But the state’s biological manipulation isn’t really what makes that possible; instead it’s a hyper-consumer culture that suppresses the human spirit. It’s a world of reductionism, where individual humans are cogs and human culture is a series of meticulously manufactured experiences.

I found my imagination wandering back to this aspect of *Brave New World* soon after cracking open *She Has Her Mother’s Laugh*. Zimmer digs into his own family’s genetic legacies, scans the history of genetic research, sheds light on recent scientific advances, and probes the frontiers of humanity’s understanding of itself. Where Huxley sees genetic heredity as one tool for degrading a free society, Zimmer sees the fraying of our collective values as a threat to our children’s inheritance.

Rarely is heredity a neatly packaged, deterministic bequest, as in the case of a single gene mutation leading to a disease like PKU, which causes cognitive disabilities beginning in infancy. [A trait like intelligence](https://medium.com/neodotlife/intelligence-genes-eb18c5ef759c) is usually fuzzy. It can be limited by something like PKU, or passed on from genius parents, but increases in intelligence over time are more closely correlated with improvements in childhood nutrition and reductions in childhood labor. Much of an individual’s intelligence is determined by wealth, education, health care, and environment.

![](1*UHyq0ZLdpRuKJZwhe3Mhrw.jpeg)

Zimmer thus insists there’s a moral imperative to approach heredity as a field greater than genetics alone. Take wealth, for example. Unlike a gene whose persistence in a bloodline is diluted over time, inter-generational wealth transfer tends to compound down a family tree through virtuous feedback loops. Global warming is a compounding inheritance, too.

In *Brave New World*, World State’s most nefarious tools are not genetic at all: physiological manipulation with an opioid-like drug called soma; brainwashing children with propaganda as they sleep; and economic hyper-stimulation through pathological consumerism. Huxley, writing later, would note that he saw these “impersonal forces” as the darkest threats to freedom.

Zimmer is on to something similar when he warns against an impersonal “genetic essentialism,” a term he uses for the idea that genetic research will one day explain the heritability of all human traits, conditions, and diseases. That idea is misguided, he shows, because the cumulative culture of humanity has a profound — if not dominant — impact on heredity.

Genetic essentialism is disempowering and can lead to moral abdication. Zimmer describes a study in which participants were divided into three groups and given articles to read. The first group read an article linking obesity to genetics, the second group read an article tying obesity to social networks, and the third group read an article about food that did not mention obesity. Then members of each group were offered cookies. The first group — informed that obesity was tied to genetics — ate the most cookies. This presumably occurred because when we assume genes shape our lives, we are less likely to take responsibility for our actions.

![](1*xYn0YV3z4kqTRszm0Va1MA.png)

Many opponents of biotechnological innovation specifically reference *Brave New World* as a reason to fear biotechnology gone awry. This, however, is an argument based in genetic determinism, lazily placing the genetic component on too high a pedestal. Today we use biotechnology to sidestep baby-killing diseases like rubella (with vaccines) or spinal muscular atrophy ([with genetic screening and assisted reproduction](https://medium.com/neodotlife/imperfect-pregnancies-and-the-language-of-genomics-e0e2da7a20c1)). Sure, the tools of biotechnology may be used for evil, but many dystopian visions of the future grossly under-emphasize the nongenetic aspects of heredity that could propel us there.

World State perpetuates itself not via conveyor belts of embryos, but by the impersonal forces of gratuitous pleasure, consumerism, complacency, and a politics of distraction. Similarly, Zimmer argues that genes, microorganisms, social structures, and global weather patterns will all be shaped by the values that we apply to the environment [inherited by our children](https://medium.com/neodotlife/daisy-robinton-genetic-legacy-785ffc03d923). That is, evolution is not just something that happens. Far from it: evolution is an ongoing process guided by an accumulated culture. We can shirk that responsibility, or we can use our freedom to choose what we pass on.

# The Anti-Aging Habits of Longevity Experts

## These people are all researching ways to halt or reverse aging. So what are they doing to help themselves live longer?

![Illustration by Victor Kerlow](1*07gU43XaweYBdS_Y1W6oqw.jpeg)*Illustration by Victor Kerlow*

W e all know what we should do to live long, healthy lives — exercise regularly, sleep well, avoid overindulgences — but aren’t there any magic pills or supplements that improve your chances even further? For some insight, I asked a number of scientists who are deep in anti-aging research what they take.

There’s no consensus. Some use the products of their research, popping pills or getting scans that they’ve started companies to develop. Others say we don’t know enough yet to risk swallowing something that might also cause harm. Someday, they all hope, science will help them and everyone else stay healthier and live longer. In the meantime, keep exercising.

Here’s what four scientists do in their own lives:

**Aubrey de Grey** insists that he never thinks about his own aging (he’s 53) and takes no steps to affect it because “the overwhelming message from research is that they will do very little good.” He adds: “I actually don’t take any such measures, other than the most important one of all, namely to try all I can to hasten the development of new therapies that will keep me and everyone else youthful in old age.” In his day job, as chief science officer and co-founder of the anti-aging non-profit SENS Research Foundation, de Grey works on an “engineering” approach to aging: [repairing damage](http://www.sens.org/research) as it occurs, to keep levels low enough that disease won’t result. His devotion to that strategy probably comes at the expense of his own aging rate, de Grey says, “mostly in the sense that I don’t get nearly enough sleep.”

**Judith Campisi**, who is in her 60s, also denies thinking much about her own fate. “I’m too busy,” says Campisi, who studies the molecular basis of aging at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging outside San Francisco. She is also a cofounder of Unity Biotechnology, a company that aims to counter aging by eliminating cells that have stopped dividing and [may be leading to disease](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6311/472).

Only slightly tongue-in-cheek, she says the main steps she takes to keep herself young and energetic are drinking wine and worrying. That’s right: rather than avoiding stress, Campisi says she embraces it. Challenging the brain with stress keeps it young, she says. She’s quick to note that she’s talking about the kind of pressure inherent in the life of a busy scientist, not the life-or-death stress of, say, a Syrian refugee.

She last took a vacation in 2009. “I just don’t have any great desire or need to go away for two weeks and sit on a beach. I’d be bored to death.” She enjoys a glass of good wine whenever she can. “I just love wine. I hang out with winemakers, things like that,” Campisi says. Not only has moderate wine drinking been associated with longevity, but having passions is healthy, she says.

**J. Craig Venter**, 70, says his science has already saved his life twice. The first time was when [he sequenced his own genome](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254). (He was the first person to ever get his own genetic code completely mapped.) That revealed he was at high risk for developing deadly skin cancer, so he became a careful observer of his skin. A few years later he detected a dangerous growth before it could spread. More recently, a workup from a company he co-founded, Health Nucleus, revealed that he had early-stage prostate cancer that was likely to become aggressive. Venter had his prostate surgically removed and has had no repercussions.

He also stays very active. His trainer comes three times a week, he plays tennis regularly, and a few days after our conversation, he was headed to the Arizona desert for a weekend of off-road motorcycle and dune buggy racing. “You can avoid a lot of significant joy in life by doing nothing,” he notes. He rides ensconced in full protective gear, including a helmet and a device that rapidly inflates into a protective bubble in an accident.

Venter has lost more than 50 pounds in recent years, mainly by more careful eating. He’s been on baby aspirin and statins for more than 20 years, because of a family history of heart disease. (His father died at age 59 of sudden cardiac death, less than two weeks after his cardiologist told him he was in fantastic shape.) He takes no vitamins or pills explicitly to extend life. However, he is on the diabetes drug metformin, which is being studied for its possible longevity benefits, since tests detected changes in his insulin sensitivity.

“I’m trying to use the best of scientific knowledge to be as healthy as I can for as long as I can,” he says. “I totally expect to die, without some radical change, some time before I’m 100 years old.”

We all know people who look older or younger than their age. In 2011, Harvard geneticist **David Sinclair** was helping to start a company called InsideTracker, which aims to measure someone’s biological rather than chronological age. At the time, Sinclair was in his early 40s, but the test said he had the body of a 57-year-old. “I said, I’m going to die young.”

Instead, he aggressively stepped up his anti-aging efforts. Sinclair was among the scientists who first pegged resveratrol, a natural compound found in red wine, as a possible anti-aging supplement. It hasn’t lived up to that hype, but just in case, he’s been taking a concentrated form of it for more than a decade.

In the last year, he added a compound called NMN (Nicotinamide mononucleotide), which [his own research](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/03/harvard-scientists-pinpoint-critical-step-in-dna-repair-cellular-aging/) in mice suggested had anti-aging effects. The benefits were dramatic, says Sinclair, who is trying to develop the compound into a drug. He quickly lost 15 pounds without significantly changing his lifestyle, bringing him back to his college weight. Sinclair is now 47, but he says InsideTracker measures him at a youthful 31.

# This Artist Shows Why Science is Too Important to Be Left to Scientists

## This Artist Shows Why Science is Too Important to Be Left to Scientists

### Lucy McRae provokes us to vividly imagine alternate futures.

Lucy McRae calls herself a “body architect.” She produces short films and live experiences that push audience members to reimagine their sense of self. It’s all about “exploring the slipperiness of where science and technology meets the body,” she says. In her latest work, which opened this week in Melbourne, Australia, an installation called *Biometric Mirror* challenges the accuracy and assumptions of facial recognition algorithms.

McRae, who is 39 and was born in London, was formally trained in ballet, architecture, and interior design, and had a stint leading the far-future research lab at Philips Design. I asked her about the purpose of making art about biotechnologies. Is it a way to communicate the results of science—to reveal its impacts? Or can art play a part in the discovery process itself and shape the way science is done?

![**In “Biometric Mirror,” visitors are invited to enter a futuristic beauty salon to have their facial features scanned and “perfected” using AI.**](1*87M-ORE6TJQ9to2rLgSGNQ.png)***In “Biometric Mirror,” visitors are invited to enter a futuristic beauty salon to have their facial features scanned and “perfected” using AI.***

“The work I do is to create a platform to discuss science and technology, who we are, and where we’re headed. Sometimes it’s not actually the physical outcome that matters: the experience is an opportunity to ask questions and to provoke.

“The idea is to have a commentary on how we don’t want a world that’s perfect, because if we do—and we’re headed towards that world—we’re all going to look the same. I’ve been talking to a doctor friend of mine, and we’ve been discussing the cognitive and neurological relationship between perfection and happiness. Once you get to this top of the mountain, as it were, after you wind down from the high, you become disappointed because the challenge is over. I think that’s a really interesting exploration into what we’re feeding artificial intelligence. Can we incorporate accident, imperfection, and serendipity into machine learning? And if we don’t, what do we get?”


“[My inspiration] can be totally random. For example, I was just at a conference in Tel Aviv for four days, and went to Jerusalem for the day. I was just blown away and transported by the kind of storytelling and coexistence of these big mythologies. And that made me realize how important speculative design and narratives are in telling, and explaining, future scenarios. The Future Day Spa idea came to me when I was interested in the concept of the body beyond Earth’s edge. I met an economist from NASA who told me that they were concerned with the complications of growing a fetus in zero gravity, and that was it: That became my brief for the next two years.

“I get a lot of inspiration from meeting people who are very different to me. I like being uncomfortable, and being the anomaly amongst a group of people, because I feel like I learn so much more. I’m much more provoked.”

“I’m not scared of technology. The types of people I come into contact with, and the kinds of research I’m included in, give me a great, positive outlook. And if I’m scared or if I’m negative, then I’m not really helping progress in any way.

“My work is commenting or responding to signals that I pick up, exploring the ideologies and ethics around technology, and just offering more questions. I’m not suggesting I have the answers. Actually, whether I’m negative or positive isn’t an important aspect of what I do.

“Maybe it’s more important to be asking the right questions.”

“When you bring an artist, a biologist, and a technologist together, communication happens in a different way. So, if artists can get in early to the scientific or innovation process, then the future of science — the vision of science — won’t be monopolized by scientists. You need design or art or narrative or fiction to be able to communicate that idea, for it to be accessible, so it can bridge the fringes of culture and become more diverse.

“What I encourage is for us to have a vast openness around science, for it to become interdisciplinary rather than being kept behind the lab doors of scientists. I think that’s one of the roles that’s going on in the art and design world: opening up these gateways to science and questioning the ethics of its outcome.”


“I don’t have a ‘too far’ limit. The work I do is about blurring boundaries, and I have a healthy disregard for any kind of traditional labels or limitations. I’m actually interested in concepts that may be too far. Beaming a ray of light into the brain, one that is able to refashion chunks of our experience by triggering pleasure and erasing memory — I would assume a lot of people think that’s ‘too far.’ But I’m very interested in that technology — optogenetics.”

“This idea about businesses or biologists operating more like an art studio: If you could do that, then you bring about more chaos, more serendipity, and epiphany to designing innovation — and you have no idea what you’re going to get. I think we are at a point now where we need to design from a place of being vulnerable and not knowing — being open to epiphany and being okay with ending up in a place where you didn’t want to start. The problem some people have with that is they need to know from the beginning where they’re going to end, how long it’s going to take to get there, what’s it going to look like. If you’re willing to jump on an artistic process, we can’t you promise you specific outcomes, but we can promise you that it’ll be way grander, way greater, way more provocative.”

# What if Number 2 Makes You Number 1?

## What if Number 2 Makes You Number 1?

### Elite athletes have a greater variety of bacteria in their guts than couch potatoes do, raising the prospect of “poop doping.”

“Poop doping” is an unlikely phrase that began appearing in headlines after a scientist [claimed](http://www.bicycling.com/training/is-poop-doping-the-next-big-thing) that a do-it-herself fecal transplant from a competitive cyclist had improved her health and athleticism. Other researchers objected to the lack of evidence for this claim. But it was too tantalizing for many news outlets to ignore. UC Davis microbiologist Jonathan Eisen, who tracked the coverage on his blog, [lamented](https://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2017/06/more-awful-reporting-on-poop-doping.html), “The crap keeps flowing.”

The microbiome — the vast community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies — is still a new field of study. Scientists are only starting to understand the complex connections between these bugs and our health. A few studies have found differences in the gut microbes of athletes and non-athletes, but researchers haven’t teased apart causes and effects. Our diets, exercise routines, microbes, and other factors may be tangled together like cyclists in a peloton.

One of those studies came from Orla O’Sullivan, a computational biologist at Teagasc Food Research Centre in Cork, Ireland, and her colleagues. They scrutinized the gut bugs of a professional rugby team for a 2014 study. The researchers analyzed the bacteria in fecal samples from the 40 athletes and 43 control subjects; they also looked at other factors such as diet and body composition.

“We were very excited to see the athlete microbiome is distinct from the controls,” O’Sullivan says. “And what was even more exciting is that there was a huge increase in diversity of the athlete microbiomes.”** **In other words, when compared to control subjects, athletes had a [greater variety of species in their gut ecosystems](http://gut.bmj.com/content/63/12/1913).

It matters, O’Sullivan says, because “people with higher diversity tend to be healthier.” Hers wasn’t the only study to find a link between exercise and microbial diversity. Mehrbod Estaki, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia, led a [2016 study](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0189-7) of 39 men and women, looking at their fitness and feces. That study found that people in better shape (as measured by their VO2 peak, the maximum amount of oxygen used during an exercise test) had more diverse gut microbes.

A [2017 study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171352) of 40 women compared the microbiomes of those who did less than 1.5 hours of physical activity a week to those who did three hours or more. The researchers found that certain types of bacteria were more common in the active women. Unlike in the other studies, they didn’t find higher biodiversity in exercisers. But author Mar Larrosa of European University in Madrid, Spain, says this may depend on the intensity of the exercise.
> # “Microbiome work is a perfect breeding ground for snake oil.”

O’Sullivan stresses that her studies and others have only found correlations between exercise and patterns in the microbiome. The researchers don’t know whether one thing causes the other. Even if rugby players have healthier microbiomes, O’Sullivan doesn’t think people should start giving themselves transplants of rugby players’ feces. “God, no!” she says.

It’s tricky to separate the effects of exercise from those that come from diet. “People who embark on an exercise plan tend to also change their diet,” O’Sullivan says. Maybe they start eating more healthily, or they eat more because they’re hungrier, or they reward themselves with candy bars after gym visits. In the guts of the rugby players, microbial diversity correlated both to exercise and to how much protein people ate.

Although diet likely affects an athlete’s microbial makeup, exercise itself could have an impact too. Maybe exercise encourages or discourages the growth of certain bacteria by speeding up the rate at which food passes through the gut, O’Sullivan says. (This could be what’s happening when long-distance runners get diarrhea). Or perhaps exercise changes the physical structure of the gut just like it changes the muscles, bones, and blood vessels, Estaki says, and this affects the microbiome.

Additionally, some other factors beyond diet and exercise probably influence athletes’ microbiomes. Their genes, for example. Or their exposure to the world. Estaki suggests that fitter people might change their microbiomes by spending more time on athletic fields or in locker rooms, or simply by enjoying the outdoors.

“Every single thing that we do will have some kind of impact on the microbiome,” O’Sullivan says.
[**Also from NEO.LIFE: Skinny Genes**
*Anorexia may originate in your gut and your DNA, not in fashion magazines.](https://medium.com/neodotlife/skinny-genes-a3db475b37cc)*

It makes sense that exercise could change our gut microbes. “Perhaps the most interesting question,” Estaki says, is the opposite one: Can our gut microbes change the way we exercise?

This was what the poop doping story claimed, albeit without evidence. But it’s not impossible. The gut is linked to the brain and behavior. Microbes in your intestines can alter your body’s levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, and they produce their own molecules that can interact with the brain. Maybe certain people are more athletic because their microbes help motivate them to exercise, Estaki speculates. Or perhaps their microbes help them get more benefit from the same amount of work. Larrosa says gut microbes can produce molecules that affect muscle physiology. A [study](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2015/02000/Effect_of_Intestinal_Microbiota_on_Exercise.33.aspx) in Taiwan of germ-free mice — lab animals with no gut microbes at all — found that these mice were weaker endurance swimmers.

To start teasing apart the relationships between diet, exercise, and microbes, O’Sullivan’s group just wrapped up a study that assigned inactive subjects to start exercising, eat more protein, or both. The researchers will also look into the microbes of athletes besides rugby players — including rowers, track and field athletes, and cricketers.

Microbiome research is “very hot right now,” says Eisen, who debunked the poop doping story on his blog. Excitement about the field, combined with the difficulty of actually studying or understanding the microbiome, can lead to oversold results. He says the most common issue is that people misinterpret correlations as causal relationships. A group of cyclists has a certain microbial profile, say, and a researcher suggests that the microbes make their hosts better athletes — even when they’re transplanted. “Sadly,” Eisen says, “microbiome work is a perfect breeding ground for snake oil.”
