Although the energy of the explosion was enormous, the gravitational waves we see are so fast that light cannot travel fast enough to be seen.\\n\\nThe new image, released in 2016, reveals X-ray alonghttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496348323715-c11f0fc6aeed?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjgwNzY1fQible-light emissions.\\n\\n![Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/MSSL/R.Soria et al, Optical: AURA/Gemini OBs](<|image|>)&ahttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496348323715-c11f0fc6aeed?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjgwNzY1fQCredit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/MSSL/R.Soria et al, Optical: AURA/Gemini OBs&ast;&ast;*\\n\\n3.

The largest stars in our night sky, such as our sun and the planets Mars and Jupiter, are classified as white dwarfs, so named because they seem to be so massive. In comparison, the biggest stars seen in the night sky, such as the sun and the huge planets, are red dwarfs, or small stars that scientists cannot easily make out because they are so massive.\\n\\nThe new images from Hubble’s Hubble Space Telescope show a series of three galaxies interacting in unprecedented detail, with ultraviolet light streaming out of the central black hole and streaming through the event horizon. These images are too extreme to see anything else visible, but Gibson understands that the technology isn’t available to survey the entire arc. “It has to be a region that can be explored using the technologies we have now,” he says.\\n\\nScientists can’t predict how a black hole in a galaxy would eventually manage to consume a star. “We don’t know how massive the black holes are, how stable they are,” says Gibson. “We don’t know how hot they are, how much they are able to consume.”\\n\\nScientists can only guess at the ultimate fate of the dinosaurs if another star passes too close. “Just because there’s a possibility that another star might be able to provide some material doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t look into it,” says Hammel. “It just means it’s a possibility.”\\n\\nScientists can’t predict how a black hole in a galaxy will consume a star, or even whether or not a star will eventually receive any energy from a black hole. Even if we discovered life outside the solar system, discovering another planet in the process could be the final nail in the coffin.\\n\\n“It’s pretty straightforward,” says Hammel. “You take a supernova and you make a black hole.”\\n\\nBlack holes are black because even when we see them, they’re so small. While our sun is huge, the black hole we’re dealing with is so tiny. Even when we discover life outside the solar system, van Hoed continues to carry on a conversation with scientists, and hopes to one day lead NASA to the same place he has found a white dwarf.\\n\\n“I think this is really critical. We need to listen to what our colleagues in Europe and elsewhere are saying,” he says. “They’re really leading the way.',\n",

The explosion — which scientists call a black hole — has persisted even though the star has since faded from view.\\n\\nThe explosion of Scorpio, first spotted by NASA’s Voyager mission in 1977, has persisted for years despite being located thousands of light-years away in the constellation Scorpio. New imaging studies by the HiRISE camera revealed the star to be a relatively massive star, with remnants of a planetary nebula and magnetic field that we see through the Hubble Space Telescope.\\n\\nIn 2001, another team of researchers3 released the paper “[Eta Carinae: The Giant Star in the Night Sky](https://github.com/sirmammingtonham/futureMAG)” in which they made a supernova explosion sound like a typical giant star. The explosion, which they christened the Great Synodic Event (GTEO), shocked the surrounding area and eventually revealed a violent X-ray glow that we can see through the Hubble Space Telescope. Although the energy of the explosion was enormous, the gravitational waves we see are so fast that light cannot travel fast enough to be seen.\\n\\nThe new image, released in 2016, reveals X-ray alonghttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496348323715-c11f0fc6aeed?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjgwNzY1fQible-light emissions.\\n\\n![Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/MSSL/R.Soria et al, Optical: AURA/Gemini OBs](<|image|>)&ahttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496348323715-c11f0fc6aeed?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjgwNzY1fQCredit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/MSSL/R.Soria et al, Optical: AURA/Gemini OBs&ast;&ast;*\\n\\n3.

The largest stars in our night sky, such as our sun and the planets Mars and Jupiter, are classified as white dwarfs, so named because they seem to be so massive. In comparison, the biggest stars seen in the night sky, such as the sun and the huge planets, are red dwarfs, or small stars that scientists cannot easily make out because they are so massive.\\n\\nThe new images from Hubble’s Hubble Space Telescope show a series of three galaxies interacting in unprecedented detail, with ultraviolet light streaming out of the central black hole and streaming through the event horizon. These images are too extreme to see anything else visible, but Gibson understands that the technology isn’t available to survey the entire arc. “It has to be a region that can be explored using the technologies we have now,” he says.\\n\\nScientists can’t predict how a black hole in a galaxy would eventually manage to consume a star. “We don’t know how massive the black holes are, how stable they are,” says Gibson. “We don’t know how hot they are, how much they are able to consume.”\\n\\nScientists can only guess at the ultimate fate of the dinosaurs if another star passes too close. “Just because there’s a possibility that another star might be able to provide some material doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t look into it,” says Hammel. “It just means it’s a possibility.”\\n\\nScientists can’t predict how a black hole in a galaxy will consume a star, or even whether or not a star will eventually receive any energy from a black hole. Even if we discovered life outside the solar system, discovering another planet in the process could be the final nail in the coffin.\\n\\n“It’s pretty straightforward,” says Hammel. “You take a supernova and you make a black hole.”\\n\\nBlack holes are black because even when we see them, they’re so small. While our sun is huge, the black hole we’re dealing with is so tiny. Even when we discover life outside the solar system, van Hoed continues to carry on a conversation with scientists, and hopes to one day lead NASA to the same place he has found a white dwarf.\\n\\n“I think this is really critical. We need to listen to what our colleagues in Europe and elsewhere are saying,” he says. “They’re really leading the way.*This article was written by a [GPT-2 neural network](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models).
