**The Future of Storytelling — Told by AI.**

Creating a medium publication with articles generated solely with ai:

* Uses a GPT-2 neural network finetuned on articles from various medium publications to generate the articles.
  * Uses my fork of [gpt-2-simple](https://github.com/sirmammingtonham/gpt-2-simple) for training and generation (it's pretty far behind the main repo but allows for longer text generation). 
* Data scraped using a modified version of the [mediumexporter](https://github.com/xdamman/mediumexporter) library.
